The **SimpleDiagnostic** intervention class identifies infected individuals, regardless of disease state, based on specified diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Diagnostics are a key component of modern disease control efforts, whether used to identify high-risk individuals, infected individuals, or drug resistance. This intervention class distributes a specified intervention to a fraction of individuals who test positive.

.. only:: tb

    To specify additional outcomes for individuals who test negative or who default (in other words,
    who do not receive their test result), use **DiagnosticTreatNeg** instead.
