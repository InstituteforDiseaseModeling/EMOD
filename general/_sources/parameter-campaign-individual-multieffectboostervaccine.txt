MultiEffectBoosterVaccine
=========================

The **MultiEffectBoosterVaccine** intervention class is derived from **MultiEffectVaccine** and
preserves many of the same parameters. Upon distribution and successful take, the vaccine’s effect
in each immunity compartment (acquisition, transmission,  and mortality) is determined by the
recipient’s immune state. If the recipient’s immunity modifier in the corresponding compartment is
above a user-specified threshold, then the vaccine’s initial effect will be equal to the
corresponding priming parameter. If the recipient’s immune modifier is below this threshold, then
the vaccine’s initial effect will be equal to the corresponding boost parameter. After distribution,
the effect wanes, just like a :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-multieffectvaccine`. The behavior
is intended to mimic biological priming and boosting.
