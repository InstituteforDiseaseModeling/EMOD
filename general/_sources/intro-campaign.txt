=============
Campaign file
=============

The :term:`campaign file` is an optional file that distributes outbreaks and contains all parameters
that define the collection of interventions that make up a disease eradication :term:`campaign`. For
example,

* When, how, and who to test for a disease
* When, how, and who to distribute treatments to
* The vaccines or other preventative interventions to use
* The medications to use for treatment

Like the :term:`configuration file`, the campaign file is a :term:`JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON)` formatted file. It is hierarchically organized into logical groups of parameters that can
have arbitrary levels of nesting. For some interventions, there can be a very complex
hierarchical structure, including recursion. Typically, the file is named campaign.json. The
relative path to this file is specified by **Campaign_Filename** in the configuration file.

To distribute an intervention, you must configure the following:

campaign event
    A JSON object that determines **when** and **where** an intervention is distributed during a campaign.
event coordinator
    A JSON object that determines **who** will receive a particular intervention during a campaign.
intervention
    A JSON object that determines **what** will be distributed to reduce the spread of a disease. An
    intervention can be distributed either to an individual (such as a vaccine, drug, or bednet) or
    to a node (such as a larvicide). Sometimes this can be an intermediate intervention that
    schedules another intervention.

.. only:: not training

    |IDM_s| provides complete simulation scenarios in the Regression_ directory
    on GitHub. Within each of the simulation subdirectories, there is a campaign.json file. The
    Scenarios subdirectory contains the files used in the |quick| tutorials.

    .. _Regression: https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/EMOD/tree/master/Regression

.. only:: training

    The |quick| includes complete simulation scenarios in the Scenarios directory. Within each of the
    scenario subdirectories, there is a campaign.json file.

Overlay file
==============

As you work more with |EMOD_s|, you may want to change the values of a view parameters of interest
while keeping the rest constant, for example, when running simulation experiments or testing source
code changes.

You have the option of creating an :term:`overlay file` to keep campaign parameters of
interest in a separate file from the complete campaign file that contains default values. These
files can be flattened into a single file and the values in the overlay file will override those
in the default file.

.. only:: training

    While some of the scenarios in the |quick| include an overlay file, it is only to highlight
    certain campaign settings, not override any default values.

See :doc:`parameter-campaign` for a comprehensive list and description of all parameters
available to use in the campaign file for this simulation type.
