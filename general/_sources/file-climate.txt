======================
Climate file structure
======================

There are two general types of climate files usable by |EMOD_s|, namely, climate files generated
through actual data, referred to as "climate by data," and climate files generated from the Koppen
classification system, referred to as "climate by Koppen". Climate data (both types) is contained in
a set of two files, a metadata file with header information (<name>.bin.json) and a binary data file
(<name>.bin). Both files are required.

The metadata file is a JSON-formatted file that includes a metadata section and a node offsets
section. The **Metadata** parameter contains a JSON object with parameters, some of which are
strictly  informational and some of which are used by |exe_s|. However, the informational ones may
still be important to understand the provenance and meaning of the data.

In a second section, the **NodeOffsets** parameter contains a list of hex-encoded 16-byte values
used to find the data for each given node (the **NodeID**).They are not 16-byte offsets, but
instead, two 8-byte hex-encoded character strings. This encoding includes the source **NodeID**. You
can map the binary data to its corresponding source **NodeID** by using the **NodeOffset**
information.

.. TODO add more information here later. This isn't very clear.

The binary file contains the climate data in a sequential stream. In other words, it presents
all the data for the first node, then all the data for the second node, all the way through to the
last node.

To use the climate files, you must set **Climate_Model** to either "CLIMATE_BY_DATA" or
"CLIMATE_BY_KOPPEN", as appropriate, in the configuration file. There are also additional parameters
in the configuration file you can use to scale or otherwise modify the data included in the
climate files.

Climate by data
===============

At this time, the |exe_l| reads land temperature data, but does not use the data in any
calculations. |IDM_s| clones the air temperature and uses that as the land temperature in the
climate data files. If you are going to be constructing your own climate files, we advise you to do
the same.

Metadata file
-------------

The following parameters in the metadata section are informational:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Description
    :widths: 10,5,20

    DateCreated, string, The day the file was created.
    Author, string, The author of the file.
    OriginalDataYears, string, The years from which the original data was derived.
    StartDayOfYear, string, The day of the year representing the first day in the climate file.
    DataProvenance, string, The source of the data.

The following parameters in the metadata section are used by |exe_s|:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Description
    :widths: 10,5,20

    IdReference, string, "A unique, user-selected string that indicates the method used for generating **NodeID** values in the input file. For more information, see :doc:`file-inputs`."
    NodeCount, integer, The number of nodes to expect in this file.
    DatavalueCount, integer, The number of data values per node. The number must be the same across every node in the binary file.
    UpdateResolution, enum, "The time resolution of the climate file. Available values are:

    * CLIMATE_UPDATE_YEAR
    * CLIMATE_UPDATE_MONTH
    * CLIMATE_UPDATE_WEEK
    * CLIMATE_UPDATE_DAY
    * CLIMATE_UPDATE_HOUR"

An example of climate by data metadata is as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../json/climate-by-data-metadata.json
   :language: json

Binary file
-----------

The binary file is a stream of 4-byte floating point values that contain the data value at the data
count position for a given node, running from 1 to the maximum data count value.

The binary format is as follows:

.. image:: ../images/file-structure/climate-by-data-binary.jpg

Climate by Koppen
=================

The Koppen_ classification system is one of the most widely used climate classification systems. The
Koppen classification system makes the assumption that native vegetation is the best expression of
climate.

.. _Koppen: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification

Metadata file
-------------

The following parameters in the metadata section are informational:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Description

    DateCreated, string, The day the file was created.
    Author, string, The author of the file.
    DataProvenance, string, The source of the data.
    Tool, string, The script used to create the file.

The following parameters in the metadata section are used by |exe_s|:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Description

    IdReference, string, "A unique, user-selected string that indicates the method used for generating **NodeID** values in the input file. For more information, see :doc:`file-inputs`."
    NodeCount, integer, The number of nodes to expect in this file.

An example of climate by Koppen metadata is as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../json/climate-by-koppen-metadata.json
   :language: json

Binary file
-----------

The binary file parameters use the naming convention below to store the data.

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Description

    KoppenIndexX, "integer, 4 bytes", "The Koppen Index value, with X running from 1 to the maximum number of nodes."

The binary format is as follows:

.. image:: ../images/file-structure/climate-by-koppen-binary.jpg
