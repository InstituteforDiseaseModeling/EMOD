NodeLevelHealthTriggeredIV
==========================

The **NodeLevelHealthTriggeredIV** intervention class distributes an intervention to an individual when a
specific event occurs. **NodeLevelHealthTriggeredIV** monitors for event triggers from individuals,
and when found, will distribute the intervention. For example, **NodeLevelHealthTriggeredIV** can be
configured such that all individuals will be given a diagnostic intervention when they transition
from susceptible to infectious. During the simulation, when individuals become infected, they
broadcast the **NewInfectionEvent** trigger and **NodeLevelHealthTriggeredIV** distributes the
diagnostic intervention to them.
