Custom reporters
================

Reporters extract simulation data, aggregate it, and output it to a file known as an :term:`output
report`. You can process the report data using tools, such as Python or MATLAB, to create graphs and
charts for analysis. |EMOD_s| provides built-in reporters that are part of the |exe_l| and can be
enabled or disabled by setting parameters in the :term:`configuration file`. See :doc:`file-outputs`
for a list of the reports that are available using built-in reporters.

In addition, you can use custom reporters that extract data from the simulation and aren't part of
the |exe_s|. A custom reporter is an :term:`EMODule` that you plug in to |EMOD_s|. Custom reporters
are not supported for |Centos|. There are several reporters in the GitHub reporters_ directory that
you can use. You may also want to build your own custom reporter to create a new output report.

The |exe_s| must load the reporter when running a simulation to use it. If it is loaded, the output
report will be automatically generated at the end of the simulation. There are three ways to specify
their location so |exe_s| can load them. |exe_s| attempts to load the file using the following
methods, in the order listed:

#.  Define the location of the :term:`dynamic link library (DLL)` in a JSON-formatted file (emodules_map.json).
#.  Point to the location using the ``--dll-path`` command-line option when invoking |exe_s|.
#.  Place the DLL in the :term:`working directory`.

JSON file
=========

First, |exe_s| looks for an emodules_map.json file in the working directory. This map file lists
specific reporter DLLs and their exact location. This is useful if you want to store all custom
reporters in the same directory, but only want certain reporters to be used with each simulation.

The emodules_map.json file has three sections: diseases, interventions and reporters. Each section
is a JSON array and contains the path to each |module| in the array. Although reporter |modules| are
the only type currently supported, empty disease and intervention sections must be included. You
must use either a double backslash (\\\\) or a single forward slash (/) to represent a single
backslash for the path. For example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "disease_plugins": [
             ],
        "interventions": [
             ],
        "reporter_plugins": [
            "C:\\src\\EMOD\\x64\\Release\\emodules\\reporter_plugins\\libreportpluginbasic.dll"
        ]
    }

Command-line option
===================

If a map file is not provided, you can include the ``--dll-path`` option when you invoke |exe_s|. It
must point to a directory with a reporter_plugins subdirectory that contains the reporters. The name
of the directory does not matter, but the reporter must be in a subdirectory named reporter_plugins.
Note that this method will load all reporters in the root directory specified.

If you build custom reporters as described here, the DLLs will be saved to the following
directories, depending on the build configuration:

* <EMOD source directory path>\x64\Release\reporter_plugins
* <EMOD source directory path>\x64\Debug\reporter_plugins

Therefore, if you do not move your reports, you will set ``--dll-path`` to one of the following paths:

* <EMOD source directory path>\x64\Release
* <EMOD source directory path>\x64\Debug

For more information on |EMOD_s| command-line options, see :doc:`howto-simulation-cli`.

Working directory
=================

Finally, if neither the the map file or the command-line option are provided, |exe_s| looks for the
reporter plug-in in the current working directory.
