Configure heterogeneous disease transmission
===================================================

.. only:: not generic

    Only generic simulations can use |HINT_l| to manually configure heterogeneous disease
    transmission within each node. All other simulation types have preconfigured solutions for
    heterogeneous disease transmission based on the biological processes of the disease being
    modeled. Because |HINT_s| cannot be used with this simulation type, the parameter
    **Enable_Heterogeneous_Intranode_Transmission** in the configuration file must be set to 0
    (zero).

.. only:: generic

    By default, |EMOD_l| assumes disease transmission is homogeneous across a population within each
    node when using the generic simulation type. That is, the population within a node is "well-mixed"
    and has a homogeneous pattern of mixing. Disease transmission is configured by the parameter
    **Base_Infectivity**, which determines a single transmission constant, :math:`\beta_0`, to calculate
    the transmission rate for each individual. These assumptions simplify the mathematical calculations
    that are performed when running a :term:`simulation`.

    However, these assumptions do not reflect the true complexity of disease transmission in a
    population. The dynamics of transmission for some diseases are influenced by heterogeneous contact
    patterns. Several studies have shown that contact pattern is not random and correlates with specific
    characteristics, such as age, household and community structure, and spatial movement. When modeling
    scenarios with large heterogeneities, such as accessibility to health care or age groups, a
    simulation without heterogeneous mixing cannot incorporate these population segments in a node.

    This topic describes how to use the |HINT_s| feature to add heterogeneous transmission to your
    generic model by defining population groups and the transmission rate between each of these
    groups. :doc:`hint-scaling` describes the mathematics underpinning |HINT_s|. The `training
    documentation`_ also contains tutorials demonstrating how to use this feature.

    .. _training documentation: ./../training/hint-tutorial-overview.html

    #.  In the configuration file, set the following:

        *   **Enable_Heterogeneous_Intranode_Transmission** to 1.

        *   **Base_Infectivity** to your desired value.

    #.  If you have not already created population groups in the demographics file, create them using
        the steps in :doc:`howto-demographics-heterogeneity`.
    #.  In the demographics file, within the **IndividualProperties** array, add the **TransmissionMatrix**
        parameter and assign it an empty JSON object.
    #.  In the object, set the following:

        *   **Route** to the the transmission route (currently "Contact" is the only supported
            value).

        *   **Matrix** to an array that contains a :term:`WAIFW matrix`
            that scales the base infectivity set in the configuration file. This matrix is described in
            more detail below.

    Transmission matrix
    ===================

    The matrix is :math:`n \times n` sized, where :math:`n` is the number of groups defined in
    **IndividualProperties**. Each value in the matrix contains the :math:`\beta` value by which to
    scale the base infectivity, :math:`\beta_0`, for the simulation. Rows represent *from* whom the
    disease is transmitted and columns represent *to* whom the disease is transmitted, in terms of the
    group the individual belongs to.

    For example, the following demographics file configures |HINT_s| for transmission between individuals
    in high-risk and low-risk groups.

    .. literalinclude:: ../json/howto-hint1.json
       :language: json

    Based on the order the property values are listed, the high-risk group is represented in the first
    column and first row; the low-risk group is represented in the second column and second row. The
    following matrix represents the direction of the disease transmission between the groups:

    .. math::

            WAIFW = \begin{pmatrix}
            \text{High Risk} \rightarrow \text{High Risk} & \text{High Risk} \rightarrow \text{Low Risk}\\
            \text{Low Risk} \rightarrow \text{High Risk} & \text{Low Risk} \rightarrow \text{Low Risk}\\
            \end{pmatrix}

    Multiple properties
    ===================

    When a simulation has more than one **Property**, an individual will belong to one group in each **Property** type.

    The :math:`\beta` values for the different groups that an individual belongs to are multiplied
    together to create the transmission constant. In the following example, an individual who is high
    risk and suburban will have the following transmission multiplier when interacting with an
    individual who is a low risk and suburban: :math:`0.1 \times 1.4 = 0.14`.
