Introduction to the software
============================

The |IDM_l| develops detailed simulations of disease transmission through the use of extensive and
complex software modeling. The primary software, |EMOD_l|, helps determine the combination of health
policies and intervention strategies that can lead to disease eradication. |EMOD_s| calculates how
diseases may spread in particular areas and is used to analyze the effects of current and future
health policies and intervention strategies. It supports infectious disease campaign planning, data
gathering, new product development, and policy decisions. We share this modeling software with the
research community to advance the understanding of disease dynamics.

.. include:: ../reuse/sim-types.txt

The illustration below shows how the simulation types are built upon one another. All parameters
available in the generic :term:`simulation type` are inherited by the vector simulation type. The
vector simulation type adds additional parameters specific to the biology of vector-borne diseases,
which in turn are inherited by the malaria simulation type and so on. Therefore, depending on the
simulation type you select, different parameters are available for you to use.

    In addition, simulation types for broader classes of disease can be extended to build your own
    disease-specific model.

   Simulation type inheritance

|EMOD_s| is a :term:`stochastic`, :term:`agent-based model` that simulates the actions and
interactions of individuals within geographic areas known as nodes to understand the disease
dynamics in a population over time. |EMOD_s| can produce statistically significant results over a
broad set of parameters and scenarios. Quantitative analysis of the simulated output enables disease
eradication efforts to make more data-driven decisions. The |IDM_s| research team has published many
articles related to modeling, as well as the modeling concepts underpinning |EMOD_s|. For a list of
published articles, see `IDM Publications`_.

    While |EMOD_s| is very powerful, it can be challenging to learn if you are not already familiar
    with epidemiology and disease modeling. If that is the case, |IDM_s| provides the |quick| for
    you to learn more about modeling disease dynamics. It has a simpler interface for running
    simulations and extensive tutorials that walk you through how to model several prepared real-
    world scenarios.

    The |quick| is installed separately from, and has fewer installation requirements than, the |EMOD_s|
    source. The |quick| is built on the same  modeling software, but has a few limitations that make
    it primarily a learning tool. It is not suitable for running large-scale simulations or
    running simulations using your own data.

    The |quick| provides the following:

    * All files needed to model many different prepared real-world scenarios
    * Extensive tutorials that walk you through how to model the scenarios
    * An |Excel| and Windows batch files to quickly and easy run simulations
    * Windows batch files to create graphs of the model output
    * Built |exe_l|

    .. include:: ../reuse/note-quickstart.txt

This section provides the conceptual overview of |EMOD_s|. The architecture diagram below shows, at
a high level, how the system functions. If you run simulations in parallel on a multi-node cluster,
there is also a Message Passing Interface (MPI) component used to pass data between multiple
instances of |EMOD_s|.

   High-level |EMOD_s| system architecture

Input data files
================

Not all files accepted as input for running a simulation are considered input data files. Rather,
:term:`input data files` contain the relatively fixed information about a population to model. For
example, climate, geography, demographics, and migration data.

Configuration file
==================

The :term:`configuration file` contains parameters that control many different aspects of the
simulation. |EMOD_s| provides hundreds of parameters for you to configure your simulation. For
example, configuration parameters can control the following:

* The disease or disease class to simulate (simulation type)
* The name and location for the input data files and output files
* Whether to include births, deaths, and migration
* Disease attributes, such as infectivity, transmission, immunity, and mortality
* The computing resources to use

Campaign file
=============

The :term:`campaign file` contains parameters that distribute outbreaks and the interventions used
to control the spread of disease. For example, campaign parameters can control the following:

* Target demographic (age, location, gender, etc.) for interventions
* Diagnostic tests to use
* The cost and timing of interventions

Running a simulation
====================

The |exe_l| accepts the input data, configuration, and campaign files and then simulates the
susceptibility and infection of individuals within each geographic :term:`node`. The simulation type
controls the transmission mechanism of the disease. After the simulation is complete, the |exe_s|
produces output reports that describe various aspects of the disease dynamics within the modeled
population.

.. only:: not training

    You can run simulations locally or on a multi-core cluster. Because the model is :term:`stochastic`,
    you must run simulations multiple times to produce scientifically valid results.

    Depending on how you run the simulation, other programs or environments external to |EMOD_s| may
    also output error and logging files.

Output files
============

After the simulation finishes, a :term:`reporter` extracts simulation data, aggregates it, and
outputs it to a file (known as an :term:`output report`). Most of the reports are also JSON files,
the most important of which is InsetChart.json. The InsetChart.json file provides simulation-wide
averages of disease prevalence at each :term:`time step`.

See the topics listed below for a more detailed explanation of each of these system components.
