.. only:: not training

    After running a simulation, the simulation data is extracted, aggregated, and saved as an
    :term:`output report`. Depending on your configuration, one or more output reports will be created,
    each of which summarize different data from the simulation. Output reports can be in JSON, CSV, or
    binary file formats.

    The |EMOD_s| functionality that produces an output report is known as a :term:`reporter`. |EMOD_s|
    provides several built-in reporters for outputting data from simulations. By default, |EMOD_s| will
    always generate the report InsetChart.json, which contains the simulation-wide average disease
    prevalence by :term:`time step`. If none of the provided reports generates the output report that
    you require, you can create a custom reporter.

    If you want to visualize the data output from an |EMOD_s| simulation, you must use graphing
    software to plot the output reports. In addition to output reports, |EMOD_s| will generate error
    and logging files to help troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.

.. only:: training

    After running a simulation, the simulation data is extracted, aggregated, and saved as an
    :term:`output report` under the output subdirectory within each scenario. The |quick| produces
    the output reports InsetChart.json, which contains the simulation-wide average disease
    :term:`prevalence`, :term:`incidence`, and other measurements by :term:`time step`, and
    BinnedReport.json, which contains the same information divided into bins. For example,
    prevalence for different age ranges.

    To visualize the output, you can then plot any measurement in the output data within the |Excel|
    for the most flexibility. Or, you can run Windows batch files to plot the InsetChart.json data
    and additional data, such as campaign cost, births, deaths, recovered population, and more.
