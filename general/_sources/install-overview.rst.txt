=====================
|EMOD_s| installation
=====================


|EMOD_l| can be installed on computers running |Windows_supp| or |Centos_supp|. For both operating
systems, there are relatively few prerequisites required and the |exe_l| or |linux_binary| is pre-
built from the latest |EMOD_s| source code release. After completing installation, you can run
simulations locally or on an HPC cluster using real-world data.

.. note::

    If you want to download and modify the |EMOD_s| source code and build the |exe_s| or |linux_binary|
    yourself, see :doc:`dev-install-overview`.
