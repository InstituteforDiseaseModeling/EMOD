Demographic summary output report
=================================

The demographic summary output report is a JSON-formatted file with the demographic
:term:`channel` output results of the simulation, consisting of simulation-wide averages
by time step. The format is identical to the inset chart output report, except the channels
reflect demographic categories, such as gender ratio. The file name is DemographicsSummary.json.

To generate the demographics summary report, set the **Enable_Demographics_Reporting** configuration
parameter to 1. The binned output report will also be generated.

The file contains a header and a channels section.
