NChooserEventCoordinatorHIV
===========================

The **NChooserEventCoordinatorHIV** coordinator class distributes an individual-level intervention to exactly N
people of a targeted demographic in HIV simulations. This contrasts with other event coordinators
that distribute an intervention to a percentage of the population, not to an exact count. This event
coordinator is similar to the **NChooserEventCoordinator** for other simulation types, but replaces
start and end days with start and end years an includes HIV-specific restrictions that individuals
must have in order to qualify for the intervention.
