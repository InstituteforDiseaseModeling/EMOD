EMOD - V2.22
============
Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD), is an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates the simultaneous interactions of agents in an effort to recreate complex phenomena. Each agent (such as a human or vector) can be assigned a variety of “properties” (for example, age, gender, etc.), and their behavior and interactions with one another are determined by using decision rules. These models have strong predictive power and are able to leverage spatial and temporal dynamics.

EMOD is also stochastic, meaning that there is randomness built into the model. Infection and recovery processes are represented as probabilistic Bernoulli random draws. In other words, when a susceptible person comes into contact with a pathogen, they are not guaranteed to become infected. Instead, you can imagine flipping a coin that has a λ chance of coming up tails S(t) times, and for every person who gets a “head” you say they are infected. This randomness better approximates what happens in reality. It also means that you must run many simulations to determine the probability of particular outcomes.

As of V2.22, EMOD will only support malaria and HIV and will no longer support diseases such as TB and Typhoid.


History & Publication Samples
-----------------------------
EMOD development was started by Philip Welkoff in 2010 to model malaria.  Since that time, EMOD has been used in numerous studies and policy decisions.  Below is short sample of papers about EMOD and that used EMOD:

Running EMOD
------------
Since EMOD is a stochastic model, you must run numerous realizations of each scenario in order to collect proper statistics.  You will likely need a high performance computing (HPC) platform to run these simulations.  As of July 2024, we only support a SLURM-based HPC.

To make running EMOD easier, we have created some python packages that simplify configuring, running, and plotting the results.  As of July 2024, we are working to make these packages more user friendly and will have updates coming in Q4 of 2024.
