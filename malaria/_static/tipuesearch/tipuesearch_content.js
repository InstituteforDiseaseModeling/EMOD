This section describes the software architecture used for managing campaigns. Campaigns can be very simple, such as a single intervention with fixed parameters at a point in time, or a complex, adaptive, repetitive, and responsive combination of interventions. A Campaign is a collection of events that modify a simulation. An Event is a distribution within a campaign, and an Intervention is an item that is given out, such as a vaccine, a drug or a bednet. Warning If you modify the source code to add or remove configuration or campaign parameters, you may need to update the code used to produce the schema. You must also verify that your simulations are still scientifically valid. Contents Campaign events SimulationEventContext CampaignEvent NodeSet EventCoordinator Interventions Individual-distributed interventions Node-distributed interventions Campaign events \u00b6 A campaign event triggers the campaign management system to evaluate when, where, and to whom the intervention will be distributed. This section describes the SimulationEventContext , CampaignEvent , NodeSet , and EventCoordinator classes used to manage this process. For more information on setting up campaign files, see Create a campaign file . SimulationEventContext \u00b6 The Simulation class has a nested helper class called SimulationEventContextHost , referred to as SimulationEventContext . It serves as the interface to, or manager of, CampaignEvents for the Simulation class. Incoming : The Simulation to SimulationEventContext interface contains the following methods: Method Description LoadCampaignFromFile() Loads the campaign file during simulation initialization (t=0). RegisterEventCoordinator() Registers new event coordinators. Also used by CampaignEvent during activation to notify the SimulationEventContext of a new active EventCoordinator . Update() Advances the state at each time step. VisitNodes() Called from CampaignEvent during its activation. CampaignEvent is not a Node container, so it needs to communicate with the Simulation class to do anything with nodes. Outgoing : The SimulationEventContext communicates with CampaignEvents and EventCoordinators , which are described below. CampaignEvent \u00b6 The CampaignEvent class exists primarily as an initialization-time, minimal intelligence container with a 1-to-1 mapping for CampaignEvents found in the JSON campaign file. They do not do much in the way of run-time campaign distribution or control. Incoming : The public interface for CampaignEvent contains the following methods: Method Description CreateInstance() For each campaign event that the SimulationEventContext finds in the campaign file, it creates a corresponding CampaignEvent instance via CampaignEventFactory . The nested JSON elements in a campaign event are stored as an opaque (that is, unparsed) JSON object known as Event_Coordinator_Config . Immediate parameters like Start_Day are parsed out of the JSON and stored in explicit variables in the CampaignEvent class. Dispatch() In its steady-state, the SimulationEventContext checks the start day for all existing CampaignEvents and invokes this method to when the time step matches the start day. Outgoing : The CampaignEvent communicates with two other classes: NodeSet and EventCoordinator . NodeSet \u00b6 The NodeSet class parses the Nodeset_Config and helps the EventCoordinator determine if a given node is included in a particular intervention distribution. It can be as simple as NodeSetAll , which includes all nodes, or something much more involved. Usual cases include NodeSetPolygon and NodeSetCommunityList . Incoming : The public interface for NodeSet contains the following methods: Method Description Contains() The caller passes a Node via the INodeEventContext interface and gets back a Boolean. The NodeSet class completely encapsulates whatever logic is used to evaluate node membership. EventCoordinator \u00b6 EventCoordinator is a base type that contains most of the functionality in the event distribution mechanism. There are two actual EventCoordinator classes implemented, but you can new implementations easily by creating a new EventCoordinator class. Incoming : There are four classes or class groups that make calls into EventCoordinator : CampaignEvents , which create and activate them. The SimulationEventContext that invokes their steady-state methods. Nodes (via the NodeEventContext helper class) Interventions , which get EventCoordinator -level configuration data needed for intervention execution. The public interface for EventCoordinator contains the following methods: Method Description AddNode() Invoked by CampaignEvent::Dispatch() to allow the EventCoordinator to act as a node container and have access to all its constituent nodes via the INodeEventContext interface. Note The AddNode calls actually come via a delegate function that is in the EventCoordinator , but is invoked from the VisitNodes method up in the SimulationEventContext . The CampaignEvent passes the delegate function it wants used when it calls SimulationEventContext::VisitNodes() . This circuitous journey is needed because EMOD operates on a node-by-node basis and the SimulationEventContext , not the CampaignEvent , is the primary node container. CreateInstance() During their instantiation, CampaignEvents create EventCoordinators as the CampaignEvents parse the Event_Coordinator_Config , which specifies the class name and is passed by SimulationEventContext . Nothing then happens until CampaignEvent::Dispatch() is called. IsFinished() When an EventCoordinator determines that it is finished distributing its interventions, it sets an internal flag. The SimulationEventContext queries the IsFinished() function on each registered EventCoordinator and disposes of it if true. An EventCoordinator can activate and complete in a single time step, or it could last the entire length of the simulation. Update() The SimulationEventContext calls this on all registered EventCoordinators to advance their state at each time step. This method exists for global EventCoordinator communication and logic. UpdateNodes() Distributes the actual intervention. For the simplest possible use case, an EventCoordinator will distribute an intervention on its start day and then finish in that same time step. However, an EventCoordinator may implement repeating interventions, phased distributions, or sustained distributions that are contingent on node or individual attributes. Outgoing : The outgoing function calls consist of the distribution of the intervention either to individuals or nodes. For the interface between the EventCoordinator and the actual Intervention , the EventCoordinator calls InterventionFactory and passes it the remaining unparsed JSON from the campaign file. Namely, this is the Intervention_Config , the actual intervention-level campaign parameters including the intervention class. The InterventionFactory returns the newly created intervention instance for each individual via a one of two types of IDistributableIntervention interfaces. Interventions \u00b6 Interventions are the actual objects aimed at reducing the spread of disease, such as a vaccine or drug. THey can be either distributed to individuals or to nodes. For example, a vaccine is an individual-distributed intervention and a larvicide is a node-distributed intervention. Intervention is an abstract type class and specific interventions are classes that implement either IDistributableIntervention , for individual-distributed interventions, or INodeDistributableIntervention , for node-distributed interventions. The determination of whether an intervention is individual-distributed or node-distributed is contained by logic in InterventionFactory . At the beginning of the EventCoordinator::UpdateNodes()**method, the **InterventionFactory is queried with the unparsed JSON campaign file to see if it returns an INodeDistributableInterface pointer. If it does, the intervention is executed as a node-distributed intervention; if it does not, the individual- distributed intervention execution is used. Incoming : The interface to the abstract type Intervention class is the Distribute() method. It functions slightly differently for each intervention type. Outgoing : Intervention is an abstract type that interacts with Nodes or IndividualHumans with an interface specific to that intervention type. The intervention calls QueryInterface on the container to ask for a consumer interface, for example IBednetConsumer . If supported, a Give method specific to that intervention will be called, for example, GiveBednet(this) to give itself to this individual. It is then up to the internal IndividualHuman or Node logic to decide what to do with this intervention. Individual-distributed interventions \u00b6 An individual-distributed intervention implements IDistributableIntervention , a container for the actual parameter name-value pairs from the campaign file, that is contained by an IndividualContainer , an IndividualHuman helper class. The EventCoordinator calls IDistributableIntervention::Distribute() , passing the pointer IIndividualHumanDistributionContext , which provides an ISupports interface to the individual by which the intervention can request a consumer interface. This interface can then be used with Give() . In the EventCoordinator::UpdateNodes() method, the EventCoordinator organizes the distribution of Interventions to IndividualHumans mediated by Nodes , which contain the IndividualHuman objects. The EventCoordinator also applies campaign parameters at the event coordinator level (for example, Target_Demographic , Demographic_Coverage , Num_Repetitions , and Days_Between_Reps ) which mainly consists of filtering the distribution to individuals based on individual attributes. Node-distributed interventions \u00b6 A node-distributed intervention implements INodeDistributableIntervention , a container for the actual parameter name-value pairs from the campaign file, that is contained by a Node . The EventCoordinator calls INodeDistributableIntervention::Distribute() , passing the pointer INodeEventContext , which provides an ISupports interface to the individual by which the intervention can request a consumer interface. This interface can then be used with Give() . Similar to individual-distributed interventions, the EventCoordinator also applies campaign parameters for filtering the distribution. The architectural diagram below illustrates how campaign file settings are processed by an EMOD simulation. EMOD campaign architecture", "tags": "", "title": "Campaign management \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./dev-architecture-core.html", "text": "Simulation core components \u00b6 The simulation component contains core functionality that models the behavior of a disease without any interventions and extended functionality to include migration, climate, or other input data to create a more realistic simulation. Disease transmission may be more or less complex depending on the disease being modeled. Warning If you modify the source code to add or remove configuration or campaign parameters, you may need to update the code used to produce the schema. You must also verify that your simulations are still scientifically valid. Content Simulation Node IndividualHuman Disease transmission Each generic EMOD simulation contains the following core base classes: Simulation Created by the simulation controller via a SimulationFactory with each run of EMOD. Node Corresponds to a geographic area. Each simulation maintains a collection of one or more nodes. IndividualHuman Represents a human being. Creates Susceptibility and Infection objects for the collection of individuals it maintains. The file name that defines this class is \u201cIndividual\u201d and you may see it likewise shortened in diagrams. Susceptibility Manages an individual\u2019s immunity. Infection Represents an individual\u2019s infection with a disease. For vector simulations, the following corresponding classes are derived from generic classes: SimulationVector Creates NodeVector objects instead of generic Node objects. NodeVector Creates IndividualHumanVector objects instead of generic IndividualHuman objects and creates and manages VectorPopulation objects to model the mosquito vectors. IndividualHumanVector Represents a human being and provides the additional layer of functionality for how vectors interact with individual humans. VectorPopulation The mosquito species at each node, which can be represented by a collection of cohorts that counts the population of a specific state of mosquitoes ( VectorCohort ) or by a collection of individual agent mosquitoes ( VectorIndividual ). SusceptibilityVector Represents a human being\u2019s susceptibility to vector-borne disease. InfectionVector Represents a human being\u2019s infection with a vector-borne disease. Substitute these classes wherever you see the generic base classes in the architecture documentation. For malaria simulations, the following corresponding classes are derived from vector classes: SimulationMalaria Creates NodeMalaria objects instead of generic Node objects. NodeMalaria Creates IndividualHumanMalaria objects instead of generic IndividualHuman objects and provides various malaria-specific counters for the purposes of reporting. IndividualHumanMalaria Represents a human being and provides the additional layer of functionality for how malaria vectors interact with individual humans. SusceptibilityMalaria Represents a human being\u2019s susceptibility to malaria. It contains much of the intra-host model, by modeling the specific details of an individual\u2019s immune system in the context of the malaria infection life cycle. It is highly configurable, and interacts closely with InfectionMalaria objects and the IndividualHumanMalaria object, its parent. From a software point of view, SusceptibilityMalaria derives from SusceptibilityVector , but in reality SusceptibilityVector provides minimal epidemiological functionality. InfectionMalaria Represents a human being\u2019s infection with malaria. It is the other part of the detailed intra-host malaria model. It models the progression of the malaria parasite through sporozoite, schizont, hepatocyte, merozoite, and gametocyte stages. InfectionMalaria objects are contained with IndividualMalaria objects. There can be multiple such objects. They all interact closely with the SusceptibilityMalaria object. From a software point of view, InfectionMalaria derives from InfectionVector , but in reality InfectionVector provides minimal epidemiological functionality. For generic simulations, human-to-human transmission uses a homogeneous contagion pool for each node. Every individual in the node sheds disease into the pool and acquires disease from the pool. For vector-borne diseases, disease transmission is more complex as it must take into account the vector life cycle. See Disease transmission . The relationship between these classes is captured in the following figure. Simulation components After the simulation is initialized, all objects in the simulation are updated at each time step, typically a single day. Each object implements a method Update that advances the state of the objects it contains, as follows: Controller updates Simulation Simulation updates Nodes Node updates IndividualHuman IndividualHuman updates Susceptibility , Infections , and InterventionsContainer InterventionsContainer updates Interventions Simulation \u00b6 As a stochastic model, EMOD uses a random number seed for all simulations. The Simulation object has a data member (RNG) that is an object maintaining the state of the random number generator for the parent Simulation object. The only generator currently supported is pseudo-DES. The random seed is initialized from the configuration parameter Run_Number and from the process MPI rank. All child objects needing access to the RNG must be provided an appropriate (context) pointer by their owners. The Simulation class contains the following methods: Method Description Populate() Initializes the simulation. The Populate method initializes the simulation using both the configuration file and the demographic files. Populate calls through to populateFromDemographics to enable the Simulation object to create one or many Node objects populated with IndividualHumans as dictated by the demographics file, in conjunction with the sampling mode and value dictated by the configuration file. If the configuration file indicates that a migration and a climate model are to be used, those input file are also read. Populate also initializes all Reporters . Update() Advances the state of nodes. Simulation object hierarchy For multi-core parallelization, the demographics file is read in order on each process and identity of each node and is compared with a policy assigning nodes to processes embodied in objects implementing InitialLoadBalancingScheme . If the initial load balancing scheme allows a node for the current rank, the node is created via addNewNodeFromDemographics . After all nodes have been created and propagated, the NodeRankMaps are merged across all processes. See Load-balancing file structure for more information. Node \u00b6 Nodes are model abstractions that represent a population of individuals that interact in a way that does not depend on their geographic location. However, they represent a geographic location with latitude and longitude coordinates, climate information, migration links to other nodes, and miscellaneous demographic information. The Node is always the container for IndividualHumans and the contagion pool. The Node provides important capabilities for how IndividualHumans are created and managed. It can also contain a Climate object and Migration links if those features are enabled. The climate and migration settings are initialized based on the information in the input data files. The Node class contains the following methods: Method Description PopulateFromDemographics() The entry point that invokes populateNewIndividualsFromDemographics(InitPop) , which adds individuals to a simulation and initializes them. PopulateNewIndividualsFromBirth() operates similarly, but can use different distributions for demographics and initial infections. Update() Advances the state of individuals. updateInfectivity() The workhorse of the simulation, it processes the list of all individuals attached to the Node object and updates the force of infection data members in the contagion pool object. It calls a base class function updatePopulationStatistics , which processes all individuals, sets the counters for prevalence reporting, and calls IndividualHuman::GetInfectiousness for all IndividualHuman objects. The code in GetInfectiousness governs the interaction of the IndividualHuman with the contagion pool object. The rest of the code in updateInfectivity processes the contagion beyond individual contributions. This can include decay of persisting contagion, vector population dynamics, seasonality, etc. This is also where the population-summed infectivity must be scaled by the population in the case of density-independent transmission. updateVitalDynamics() Manages community level vital dynamics, primarily births, since deaths occur at the individual level. By default, an IndividualHuman object is created, tracked, and updated for every person within a node. To reduce memory usage and processing time, you may want to sample such that each IndividualHuman object represents multiple people. There are several different sampling strategies implemented, with different strategies better suited for different simulations. See Sampling for more information. If migration is enabled, at the end of the Node update, the Node moves all migrating individuals to a separate migration queue for processing. Once the full simulation time step is completed, all migrating individuals are moved from the migration queue and added to their destination nodes. IndividualHuman \u00b6 The IndividualHuman class corresponds to human beings within the simulation. Individuals are always contained by a Node object. Each IndividualHuman object may represent one or more human beings, depending on the sampling strategy and value chosen. The IndividualHuman class contains components for susceptibility, infection, and interventions. Infection and Susceptibility cooperate to represent the detailed dynamics of infection and immune mechanisms. Every IndividualHuman contains a Susceptibility object that represents the state of the immune system over time. Only an infected IndividualHuman contains an Infection object, and may contain multiple Infection objects.. Susceptibility is passed to initialize the infection immunology in Infection::InitInfectionImmunology() . The state of an individual\u2019s susceptibility and infection are updated with Update() methods. Disease-specific models have additional derived classes with properties and methods to represent specifics of the disease biology. The InterventionsContainer is the mediating structure for how interventions interrupt disease transmission or progression. Campaign distribution results in an Intervention object being added to an individual\u2019s InterventionsContainer , where it remains unless and until it is removed. When an IndividualHuman calls Update() , the InterventionsContainer is updated and its effects are applied to the IndividualHuman . These effects are used in the individual, infection, and susceptibility update operations. If migration is enabled, at the end of each individual\u2019s update step EMOD checks if the individual is scheduled for migration ( IndividualHuman::CheckForMigration() ), setting a flag accordingly. The IndividualHuman class contains the following methods: Method Description Update() Advances the state of both the infection and the immune system and then registers any necessary changes in an individual\u2019s state resulting from those dynamics (that is, death, paralysis, or clearance). It also updates intrinsic vital dynamics, intervention effects, migration, and exposure to infectivity of the appropriate social network. ExposeToInfectivity() Passes the IndividualHuman to the ExposeIndividual() function if it is exposed to infectivity at a time step. UpdateInfectiousness() Advances the quantity of contagion deposited to the contagion pool by an IndividualHuman at each time step of their infectious period. This is explained in more detail below. Disease transmission \u00b6 Transmission of disease is mediated through a pool mechanism which tracks abstract quantities of contagion. The pool mediates individual acquisition and transmission of infections as well as external processes that modify the infectivity dynamics external to individuals. The pool provides basic mechanisms for depositing, decaying, and querying quantities of contagion which are associated with a specific StrainIdentity . The pool internally manages a separate ContagionPopulation for each possible antigen identity. ContagionPopulations have further structure and manage an array of contagion quantities for each substrain identity. Each IndividualHuman has a sampling weight and a total infectiousness , the rate at which contacts with the infectious individual become infected. This rate can be modified by transmission-reducing immunity or heterogeneous contact rates, which are gathered in , and the transmission-reducing effects of interventions, such as transmission- blocking vaccines in the factor . The sampling weight is not included in the probability of acquiring a new infection. Sample particles are simulated as single individuals, their weighting is used to determine their effects upon the rest of the simulation.The total infectiousness of the local human population is then calculated as: For simulation of population density-independent transmission, individual infectiousness includes the average contact rate of the infectious individual, so this total infectiousness is divided by the population to get the force of infection for each individual in the population. The base rate of acquisition of new infections per person is then , which can be modified for each individual by their characteristics and interventions . Over a time step , the probability of an individual acquiring a new infection is then: A new infection receives an incubation period and infectious period from the input configuration (a constant at present, but possibly from specified distributions in the future) and a counter tracks the full latency, which is possible when simulating individual particles. After the incubation period, the counter for the infectious period begins, during which time the infection contributes to the individual\u2019s infectiousness . For vector-borne diseases, during an Update() for a node, the infectiousness of vectors is calculated on the local human population regarding the vector life cycle, along with the effects their interventions, such as bednets. Weather data from the Climate object is then used to update the available larval habitat for each local vector species. Multiple local vector species are supported, and after the weather updates, each vector species is advanced through a time step with the VectorPopulation::TimeStep() method. This calculates the life cycle and vector infection dynamics, along with the feeding cycle. It updates the indoor and outdoor bites, and indoor and outdoor infectious bites on the local human population. Each Individual in the local human population is then advanced in an Update() , propagating its infections forward in time, updating its interventions and infectivity, and acquiring any new infections. NodeVector::updateInfectivity() calls the VectorPopulation::TimeStep() method for mortality adjustments due to weather and the human population and, when completed, processes each list. The effects of the human population are accounted for in VectorPopulation::Update_Host_Effects() , which determines the outcomes for indoor and outdoor attempted feeds on each individual human, and then on the human population as a whole, weighting by any heterogeneous biting. The processing order is: All infectious female mosquitoes All infected female mosquitoes All adult uninfected female mosquitoes All adult male mosquitoes Immature mosquitoes All mosquito larvae All mosquito eggs After each list is updated, all indoor and outdoor bites, both infectious and non-infectious, are tallied and updated within the Node infectivity objects. Within a list update, each cohort of identical-state mosquitoes or each individual-agent mosquito experiences risk of mortality, may progress through any stage of development, such as sporogony (for infected) or larval maturation (for larval), and may attempt a blood feed (for adult females). For mosquitoes attempting a blood feed, outcomes are governed by the calculated host effects, with sequential conditional draws for choice of host type, choice of indoor or outdoor feeding location, and feed outcome. The potential feed outcomes are die before feeding, no host found, die during feeding, die post-feeding, and successful feed. Successful feeds result in ovipositions, and eggs laid start the next generation of mosquitoes.", "tags": "", "title": "Simulation core components \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./dev-architecture-environment.html", "text": "Environment subsystem \u00b6 The environment subsystem provides access to global resources and most of the external input and output interfaces.

The parsing of the input data files is done by the model classes that consume that data, which are part of the simulation controller subsystem.

Two methods of coordinated reporting are implemented: simulation-wide aggregated reporting and spatial reporting. See Output report structure for more information about the different output reports available. Simulation-wide aggregate \u00b6 Simulation-wide aggregate reporting is the most commonly used. This reporting method generates the output written to InsetChart.json. Conceptually, for each time step, the value of a named channel is derived from values provided for that channel by each node. The values are accumulated (summed) over all nodes and then transformed (often normalized by an internal parameter or another channel) just prior to writing. This is implemented through the simulation\u2019s insetChartDataAccumulator . Basic usage of the NodeTimestepDataAccumulator is explained in Report.h. The simulation is responsible for calling Begin/EndTimestep() and collecting and writing out the data at the end of the simulation. The accumulation calls occur in Node::accumulateInsetChartData() . Spatial \u00b6 The second method is spatial reporting which is facilitated by SpatialReporter . In spatial reporting, each node again produces values for named channels, but no simulation-wide accumulation takes place. Instead, the values of each channel for each node are written to a binary table (ReportNNNN.dat) where NNNN is the time step. The format of this file is simple and can be summarized as the maximally packed layout of this structure: struct ReportDataFormat { int32_t num_nodes ; int32_t num_channels ; float data [ num_nodes * num_channels ]; } Num_Channels is the number of user channels implicitly generated by the number of different channel names requested in calls to Node::reportSpatialDataReportChannels() plus two additional channels for longitude and latitude. JSON metadata for the ReportNNNN.dat files is written to Report.header.dat after the first time step. It does not include entries for latitude and longitude.

This is necessary if you want to modify the source code to extend the capabilities of the model beyond what\u2019s available with the latest EMOD release. For example, you may want to model a disease that isn\u2019t currently supported in EMOD. You can build Eradication.exe from source code on computers running Windows 10, Windows Server 12, and Windows HPC Server 12 (64-bit) or build the Eradication binary on computers running CentOS 7.1 on Azure. After building, you should run a single simulation to verify basic functionality. We recommend the 27_Vector_Sandbox scenario in the Regression directory, which is a simple five-year vector simulation with an indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaign in the third year, executed on a single-node geography that is based on Namawala, Tanzania. This simulation generally takes a few minutes to execute. However, you can run a simulation using any of the subdirectories under Regression, which when used with the input data files provided by IDM, contain complete sets of files for EMOD simulations. See Run simulations and Use input data files for more information. After that, we recommend running full regression tests to further verify that EMOD is behaving as expected and that none of the source code changes inadvertently changed the EMOD functionality. See Regression testing for more information. The EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) is tested using Windows 10, Windows Server 12, and Windows HPC Server 12 (64-bit). Windows HPC Server is used for testing remote simulations on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster and the other Windows operating systems are used to test local simulations. The Eradication binary is tested and supported on a CentOS 7.1 on Azure virtual machine. It has also been successfully built and run on Ubuntu, SUSE, and Arch, but has not been tested and is not supported on those Linux distributions.

If desired, go to https://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html and install the MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox\u2122 R2015a.", "tags": "", "title": "Prerequisites for working with EMOD source code \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./dev-logging.html", "text": "Set log levels \u00b6 EMOD simulations output several files, including log files. See Error and logging files for more information on the logging files that are created by a simulation. By default, logging is at the \u201cINFO\u201d level, but you can set the level at which you want logging information generated. If you see redundant log messages, you can also throttle logging to eliminate them. There are five log levels. The level chosen will log messages for that level and all higher levels (levels of smaller numeric value). You can set default log levels across the entire Eradication.exe or for individual files in the Eradication.exe; individual file settings will override the default. For example, if you want to increase logging for a particular file you are debugging without increasing logging across the entire Eradication.exe, you can set the default log level to \u201cWARNING\u201d and set the log level for the file to \u201cDEBUG\u201d. The standard output will reflect the default log level for all settings except \u201cERROR\u201d or \u201cWARNING\u201d. For example: Log - levels : Default -> INFO Eradication -> INFO The following log levels are available: ERROR (1) This is the highest level. Only errors, including critical errors, are logged to standard output. WARNING (2) Warnings and errors are logged to standard output. INFO (3) This is the default logging level for the executable and is set implicitly. Informational messages, warnings, and errors are logged to standard output. DEBUG (4) Debug information, informational messages, warnings, and errors are logged to standard output. Debug level logging messages do not require a debug build of Eradication.exe. This setting will generate a large number of messages and may impact performance. If you need the debugging messages, we recommend that you limit the number of files with this setting and not set it as the default across the entire Eradication.exe. VALID (5) This is the lowest level. Validation information, debug information, informational messages, warnings, and errors are logged to standard output. This log level is for very low-level debugging of specific values, including values in tight loops. Because it could severely impact performance, this level will only output to standard output during a debug build of Eradication.exe. Set default Eradication.exe level \u00b6 To set the default log level across the entire Eradication.exe, add the parameter logLevel_default to your configuration file and set it to the log level desired. For example: { \"logLevel_default\" : \"WARNING\" } Set level for individual files \u00b6 You can set the log level for an individual file, if it supports the ability. This is typically only used for debugging after making source code changes. This setting will override the default set using logLevel_default , whether set to a higher or lower level. In the C++ files that make up the EMOD source code, open the file for which you want to set the log level. Search for static const char * _module . \u201cModule\u201d refers to the C++ file and is not the same as an EMODule. If this string isn\u2019t present, you cannot set a log level for the file. Look for logging macros in the file, such as LOG_WARN(x). If macros are present, this indicates that the file supports that log level setting. The file may not support all log levels. Logging macros can be found in utils/Log.h. You can also add your own logging messages to the file using the logging macros. In the configuration file, add the logLevel_<FileName> parameter with the log level desired. For example: { \"logLevel_SimulationVectorExport\" : \"DEBUG\" } Throttle redundant logging \u00b6 It\u2019s possible that multiple identical logging messages are generated by a file of Eradication.exe. This is normal behavior, but the verbosity can be unwanted or unnecessary. You can eliminate duplicate messages by turning on \u201cthrottling\u201d, which retains only one logging message instead of a series of duplicate messages from each file. Only one copy of the message will be generated when it is one of a series of duplicates from the same file . The identical messages need not be output one right after one another to be throttled. If an identical message is output from a different file , it will still be generated. Throttling can only be enabled across the entire Eradication.exe, not per file. It is off by default. To enable throttling, add the following parameter and value to your configuration file: { \"Enable_Log_Throttling\" : 1 } For example, the following log messages are seen with throttling turned off: 00 : 00 : 00 [ 0 ] [ D ] [ FileA ] identical message : I 'm in FileA 00 : 00 : 00 [ 0 ] [ D ] [ FileB ] another message from B 00 : 00 : 00 [ 0 ] [ D ] [ FileA ] identical message : I 'm in FileA 00 : 00 : 00 [ 0 ] [ D ] [ FileB ] different message from B 00 : 00 : 00 [ 0 ] [ D ] [ FileA ] identical message : I 'm in FileA 00 : 00 : 00 [ 0 ] [ D ] [ FileB ] yet another message from B. 00 : 00 : 00 [ 0 ] [ D ] [ FileA ] identical message : I 'm in FileA With throttling on, the repeated messages from file A are removed, even though they are intermixed with other log messages from file B: 00 : 00 : 00 [ 0 ] [ D ] [ FileA ] identical message : I 'm in FileA 00 : 00 : 00 [ 0 ] [ D ] [ FileB ] another message from B 00 : 00 : 00 [ 0 ] [ D ] [ FileB ] different message from B 00 : 00 : 00 [ 0 ] [ D ] [ FileB ] yet another message from B.", "tags": "", "title": "Set log levels \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./dev-regression-new.html", "text": "Create a new regression test \u00b6 You can create a new regression based off one of the ones included with the EMOD source code using the steps below.

However, the script was written with remote execution in mind and running it locally can be time-consuming. Running the entire regression suite locally will take several hours on average. The regression scenarios, script, configuration file, and other relevant files are all in the Regression directory. Be aware that many of these tests, due to abnormally high or low values, will produce output that should not be considered scientifically accurate. Modify the configuration file, regression_test.cfg, for your environment, setting the values for the location of the working directory, input data files, binary file, and cluster settings. For local Windows simulations, set the values under [WINDOWS]. For local CentOS on Azure simulations, set the values under [POSIX]. Note that CentOS on Azure simulations are run locally by default and cannot be commissioned to an HPC cluster. For simulations on IDM HPC clusters, no changes are necessary if your username and password are cached locally. For simulations on your own HPC cluster, create [HPC-<cluster>] and [ENVIRONMENT-<cluster>] sections for your cluster that contain the same variables as shown for IDM HPC clusters. Select the suite of regression tests you want to run. This is indicated by a JSON file in the following format: { \"tests\" : [{ \"path\" : \"Relative path to test directory.\" }, { \"path\" : \"Relative path to test directory.\" }] } You can use one of the JSON files in the Regression directory or create your own. The sanity.json file is recommended for quickly testing a wide range of EMOD functionality. From the Regression directory, open a Command Prompt window and run the regression test script, regression_test.py. It requires the name of the regression suite (without the .json extension) and the relative path to Eradication.exe. For example: regression_test . py sanity .. \\ Eradication \\ x64 \\ Release \\ Eradication . exe In addition, you may need to include the following optional arguments depending on your testing environment or how Eradication.exe was built.

In addition, regression_test.py will output time.txt under the regression test working directory and report_xxxx.xml under Regression/reports. The time report contains the EMOD version and total run time of the simulation. The regression report is in JUnit standard form and captures run information, including pass/fail/complete and time to complete. If a simulation completes saying the run passed but the channel order was different than the reference output, this is considered a pass. However, if any output completes but does not match the reference output, this is considered a failure and a matplotlib chart of the output will appear in a pop-up window. The chart will appear immediately after the simulation, before the entire suite of regression tests completes.

Regression testing is a method by which the built code is tested to see if it has \u201cregressed\u201d or moved backwards in any way, such as previously reported (and fixed) issues reappearing. Within the EMOD Regression directory there are many subdirectories that correspond to different disease scenarios in a variety of locations. Each of these contains the configuration and campaign files needed to run the simulation and the reference output, which represents the expected results. These reference outputs have been calculated by the scientific researchers modeling each scenario. EMOD regression testing consists of running one or more of these simulations and comparing the output to the reference output. If the two outputs are comparable, the test passes; if they differ, the test fails. Because EMOD is stochastic , a passing test will fall within some acceptable range of the reference output, rather than be an identical match. If a regression test fails, EMOD will produce a matplotlib chart of the first 16 channels in the InsetChart.json output report . You can then review the charts to identify the problem. If you want to quickly compare a simulation output to the reference output, you can also run any of the regression scenarios as a typical simulation, as described in Run simulations .

files usable by EMOD, namely, climate files generated through actual data, referred to as \u201cclimate by data,\u201d and climate files generated from the Koppen classification system, referred to as \u201cclimate by Koppen\u201d. Climate data (both types) is contained in a set of two files, a metadata file with header information (<name>.bin.json) and a binary data file (<name>.bin). Both files are required. The metadata file is a JSON-formatted file that includes a metadata section and a node offsets section. The Metadata parameter contains a JSON object with parameters, some of which are strictly informational and some of which are used by Eradication.exe. However, the informational ones may still be important to understand the provenance and meaning of the data. In a second section, the NodeOffsets parameter contains a list of hex-encoded 16-byte values used to find the data for each given node (the NodeID ).They are not 16-byte offsets, but instead, two 8-byte hex-encoded character strings. This encoding includes the source NodeID . You can map the binary data to its corresponding source NodeID by using the NodeOffset information. The binary file contains the climate data in a sequential stream. In other words, it presents all the data for the first node, then all the data for the second node, all the way through to the last node. To use the climate files, you must set Climate_Model to either \u201cCLIMATE_BY_DATA\u201d or \u201cCLIMATE_BY_KOPPEN\u201d, as appropriate, in the configuration file. There are also additional parameters in the configuration file you can use to scale or otherwise modify the data included in the climate files. Climate by data \u00b6 At this time, the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) reads land temperature data, but does not use the data in any calculations. IDM clones the air temperature and uses that as the land temperature in the climate data files. If you are going to be constructing your own climate files, we advise you to do the same. Metadata file \u00b6 The following parameters in the metadata section are informational: Parameter Data type Description DateCreated string The day the file was created. Author string The author of the file. OriginalDataYears string The years from which the original data was derived. StartDayOfYear string The day of the year representing the first day in the climate file. DataProvenance string The source of the data. The following parameters in the metadata section are used by Eradication.exe: Parameter Data type Description IdReference string A unique, user-selected string that indicates the method used for generating NodeID values in the input file. For more information, see Input data file structure . NodeCount integer The number of nodes to expect in this file. DatavalueCount integer The number of data values per node. The number must be the same across every node in the binary file. UpdateResolution enum The time resolution of the climate file. Available values are: CLIMATE_UPDATE_YEAR CLIMATE_UPDATE_MONTH CLIMATE_UPDATE_WEEK CLIMATE_UPDATE_DAY CLIMATE_UPDATE_HOUR An example of climate by data metadata is as follows: { \"Metadata\" : { \"DateCreated\" : \"Sun Sep 25 19:02:09 2011\" , \"Tool\" : \"createclimateheader.py\" , \"Author\" : \"authorName\" , \"IdReference\" : \"Gridded world grump2.5arcmin\" , \"NodeCount\" : 1 , \"DatavalueCount\" : 3650 , \"UpdateResolution\" : \"CLIMATE_UPDATE_DAY\" , \"OriginalDataYears\" : \"1990-1993\" , \"StartDayOfYear\" : \"January 1\" , \"DataProvenance\" : \"47 consecutive months of data were used to generate one average year of data that is repeated for 10 years\" }, \"NodeOffsets\" : \"144B07A400000000\" } Binary file \u00b6 The binary file is a stream of 4-byte floating point values that contain the data value at the data count position for a given node, running from 1 to the maximum data count value. The binary format is as follows: Climate by Koppen \u00b6 The Koppen classification system is one of the most widely used climate classification systems. The Koppen classification system makes the assumption that native vegetation is the best expression of climate.

The file contains information about a particular simulation, such as the EMOD version used and the files in use, as well as other initialization information, including the default logging level and the logging levels set for particular modules. The file follows that information with log output using the following format: <timestep><HPC rank><log level><module><message>. By default, the logging level is set to \u201cINFO\u201d.

These files are in contrast to the population, geographic, and migration parameters in the configuration file that control simulation-wide qualities, such as enabling air migration across all nodes in the simulation. Generally, you will download and use input data files without modification. For instructions, see Use input data files . However, demographics files can include many user-defined parameter values and will likely require modification. Only the demographics file is required for a simulation. Each type of input data generally requires both a metadata file that contains provenance information and a binary file that contains the actual data for each node. Some input files included with EMOD were prepared using CIESIN Gridded Population of the World (GPW) population distribution and a corresponding spatial resolution grid (for example, 2.5 arc minutes) to define the initial population and extent of the nodes for country-wide input files. Therefore, the naming convention for this files usually leads with the geographic location, followed by the spatial resolution, and input file type. All input files include the parameter IdReference in the metadata, which is used to generate the NodeID associated with each node in a simulation. The values for IdReference and NodeID must be the same across all input data files used in a simulation. See Demographics parameters for more information about NodeID generation.

This can be especially helpful if the nodes vary considerably in size and, therefore, processing time. If no load balancing file is submitted, the Eradication.exe allocates simulation nodes to cores according to a checkerboard pattern. For each simulation, the load balancing file contains information about the relative level of processing time required for each geographical node . The Eradication.exe can then allocate nodes to processors in such a way that the total processing required is evenly distributed across all processors. To use a load balancing file, you must set Load_Balance_Filename to the path to the load balancing file, relative to the input file directory. Load-balancing files can be Javascript Object Notation (JSON) files, which are preferred, or binary files. JSON file \u00b6 A JSON load-balancing file contains the Load_Balance_Scheme_Nodes_On_Core_Matrix parameter, assigned an array of arrays, each of which represents a core and lists the NodeID of each node to be processed on that core. If any node contained in the demographics file is not listed in the load-balancing file, it will be processed on the first core. For example, the load-balancing file shown below distributes the processing for 100 nodes across 4 cores, assigning more nodes to particular cores when those nodes require less processing time. { \"Load_Balance_Scheme_Nodes_On_Core_Matrix\" : [ [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 45 ], [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 ], [ 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 , 71 , 72 , 73 , 74 , 75 , 76 , 77 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 , 87 , 91 , 92 , 93 , 94 , 95 , 96 , 97 ], [ 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 88 , 89 , 90 , 98 , 99 , 100 ] ] } Binary file \u00b6 A binary load-balancing file starts with an initial unsigned 4-byte integer that indicates the number of nodes. Following that value is a series of 4-byte unsigned integers representing the NodeID values. The number of values will be equal to the previously read number of nodes. Following that, another series of 4-byte floating point values, with each value representing the relative processing time required for each geographic node. Again, the number of values will be equal to the previously read number of nodes. The series of values are set up such that the entry in the series is equal to the cumulative proportion of the processing load for all the previous nodes 0 through . The cumulative nature of each node\u2019s value does not mean each node is assigned that amount for its processing load. Rather, it is a way to make the internal calculations more efficient. For example, if you had ten nodes and each node was assigned 10% of the load, the values assigned from node0 to node9 would be the following: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0. The following diagram shows the format for the binary load-balancing file data:", "tags": "", "title": "Load-balancing file structure \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./file-migration.html", "text": "Migration file structure \u00b6 There are four types of migration files that can be used by EMOD, namely, local migration, regional migration, air migration and sea migration. For all types, migration data is contained in a set of two files, a metadata file with header information and a binary data file. Both files are required. The structure of each of these files is nearly the same for all migration types, with the only exception being the number of columns in the binary file. The metadata file is a JSON-formatted file that includes a metadata section and a node offsets section. The Metadata parameter contains a JSON object with parameters, some of which are strictly informational and some of which are used by Eradication.exe. However, the informational ones may still be important to understand the provenance and meaning of the data. The following parameters in the metadata section are informational: Parameter Data type Description DateCreated string The day the file was created. Author string The author of the file. Tool string The script used to create the file. The following parameters in the metadata section are used by Eradication.exe: Parameter Data type Description IdReference string A unique, user-selected string that indicates the method used for generating NodeID values in the input file. For more information, see Input data file structure . NodeCount integer The number of nodes to expect in this file. DatavalueCount integer The number of data values per node. The number must be the same across every node in the binary file. In a second section, the NodeOffsets parameter contains a list of hex-encoded 16-byte values used to find the data for each given node (the NodeID ).They are not 16-byte offsets, but instead, two 8-byte hex-encoded character strings. This encoding includes the source NodeID . You can map the binary data to its corresponding source NodeID by using the NodeOffset information. The binary file contains the migration rate data in a sequential stream. In other words, it presents all the data for the first node, then all the data for the second node, all the way through to the last node. The data is laid out in rows and columns, with each row corresponding to a node and the number of columns varying based on the migration type. The following diagram shows how migration data is laid out in rows, with each row corresponding to a source node and each column corresponding to the destination node. Migration rate is that fraction of the node\u2019s population that is migrating per day. Units are per person per day, meaning the number of people migrating per day divided by the total population of the node. For example, if a node had 1,000 people and a migration rate of .01, there would be .01 * 1,000 = 10 people migrating per day, but if the node had 10,000 people in the node and a migration rate of .01, it would .01 * 10,000 = 100 people migrating per day. You can adjust this rate using configuration parameters for scaling (these begin with x). The binary file contains a stream of 4-byte unsigned integers that identify the destination node, followed by a stream of 8-byte double floating point values that contain the rate associated with the destination node (per person per day), running from 1 to the total number of nodes. To use the migration files, you must set Migration_Model in the configuration file to a valid migration type except \u201cNO_MIGRATION\u201d. Each migration types also requires you to set another parameter to enable the particular type of migration selected. There are also additional parameters in the configuration file you can use to scale or otherwise modify the data included in the climate files. Local \u00b6 Local migration describes the foot travel movement of people into and out of adjacent nodes. A local migration file is required for simulations that support more than one node. You must also set the Enable_Local_Migration parameter in the configuration file to 1. For each location, the local migration file represents up to eight adjacent destination nodes, with 0 used as the value for unused nodes. The following diagram shows the format for the local migration binary file data: Regional \u00b6 Regional migration describes migration that occurs on a road or rail network for a simulation. If a node is not part of the network, the regional migration of individuals to and from that node considers the closest road hub city. A Voronoi tiling based on road hubs is constructed of the region, with each non-hub connected to the hub of its tile. These connections are created when the migration file is constructed. They are not performed at runtime. A regional migration file is required for simulations that cover a geography that is large enough that road/rail migration is relevant. You must also set the Enable_Regional_Migration parameter in the configuration file to 1. For each location, the regional migration file represents up to 30 adjacent destination nodes, with 0 used as the value for unused nodes. The following diagram shows the format for the regional migration binary file data: Air \u00b6 Air migration describes migration that occurs by airplane travel. An air migration file is usually required for simulations of an entire country or larger geographies. You must also set the Enable_Air_Migration parameter in the configuration file to 1. For each location, the air migration file represents up to 60 adjacent destination nodes, with 0 used as the value for unused nodes. The following diagram shows the format for the air migration binary file data: Sea \u00b6 Sea migration describes migration that occurs by ship travel. Unlike the other migration files, the sea migration file only contains information for the nodes that are seaports. A sea migration file does not contain every node like local, regional or air migration files do. You must also set the Enable_Sea_Migration parameter in the configuration file to 1. For each location, the sea migration file represents up to five adjacent destination nodes, with 0 used as the value for unused nodes.

These reports are built in to the Eradication.exe and are either always output with each simulation, such as inset chart, or reports that you can configure to be included with the output. All output reports can be found in the output directory of the working directory, for example, 1_Generic_Seattle_MultiNodeoutput. If the available output reports do not meet your needs, you can use custom reporters that are EMODules separate from the Eradication.exe code. There are several provided in the EMOD GitHub repository or you can even write your own custom reporter to post- process and format data as you desire into a new output report.

directory", "tags": "", "title": "Index \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./glossary.html", "text": "Glossary \u00b6 The Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD) glossary is divided into the following subsections that define terms related to software usage, general epidemiology, and the particular disease being modeled. Contents Software terms Epidemiology terms Malaria and vector terms Software terms \u00b6 The following terms are used to describe both general computing processes and concepts and the files, features, and functionality related to running simulations with Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD). agent-based model A type of simulation that models the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual and collective entities such as organizations or groups). Boost Free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source libraries aimed at a wide range of uses including parallel processing applications (Boost.MPI). For more information, please see the Boost website, http://www.boost.org . boxcar function A mathematical function that is equal to zero over the entire real line except for a single interval where it is equal to a constant. campaign A collection of events that use interventions to modify a simulation . campaign event A JSON object that determines when and where an intervention is distributed during a campaign. campaign file A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted file that contains the parameters that specify the distribution instructions for all interventions used in a campaign, such as diagnostic tests, the target demographic, and the timing and cost of interventions. The location of this file is specified in the configuration file with the Campaign_Filename parameter. Typically, the file name is campaign.json. channel A property of the simulation (for example, \u201cParasite Prevalence\u201d) that is accumulated once per simulated time step and written to file, typically as an array of the accumulated values. class factory A function that instantiate objects at run-time and use information from JSON-based configuration information in the creation of these objects. configuration file A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted file that contains the parameters sufficient for initiating a simulation. It controls many different aspects of the simulation, such as population size, disease dynamics, and length of the simulation. Typically, the file name is config.json. core In computing, a core refers to an independent central processing unit (CPU) in the computer. Multi-core computers have more than one CPU. However, through technologies such as Hyper- Threading Technology (HTT or HT), a single physical core can actually act like two virtual or logical cores, and appear to the operating system as two processors. demographics file A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted file that contains the parameters that specify the demographics of a population, such as age distribution, risk, birthrate, and more. IDM provides demographics files for many geographic regions. This file is considered part of the input data files and is typically named <region>_demographics.json. disease-specific build A build of the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) built using SCons without any dynamic link libraries (DLLs). dynamic link library (DLL) Microsoft\u2019s implementation of a shared library, separate from the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe), that can be dynamically loaded (and unloaded when unneeded) at runtime. This loading can be explicit or implicit. EMODule A modular component of EMOD that are consumed and used by the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe). Under Windows, a EMODule is implemented as a dynamic link library (DLL) and, under CentOS on Azure, EMODules are currently not supported. EMODules are primarily custom reporters. Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD) The modeling software from the Institute for Disease Modeling (IDM) for disease researchers and developers to investigate disease dynamics, and to assist in combating a host of infectious diseases. You may see this referred to as Disease Transmission Kernel (DTK) in the source code. Eradication.exe Typical (default) name for the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe), whether built using monolithic build or modular (EMODule-enabled) build. event coordinator A JSON object that determines who will receive a particular intervention during a campaign. flattened file A single campaign or configuration file created by combining a default file with one or more overlay files. Multiple files must be flattened prior to running a simulation. Configuration files are flattened to a single-depth JSON file without nesting, the format required for consumption by the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe). Separating the parameters into multiple files is primarily used for testing and experimentation. Heterogeneous Intra-Node Transmission (HINT) A feature for modeling person-to-person transmission of diseases in heterogeneous population segments within a node for generic simulations. high-performance computing (HPC) The use of parallel processing for running advanced applications efficiently, reliably, and quickly. input data files Fixed information used as input to a simulation. Examples of such data are population, altitude, demographics, and transportation migrations. The configurable config.json and campaign.json files do not fall into this category of static fixed input. intervention An object aimed at reducing the spread of a disease that is distributed either to an individual; such as a vaccine, drug, or bednet; or to a node; such as a larvicide. Additionally, initial disease outbreaks and intermediate interventions that schedule another intervention are implemented as interventions in the campaign file . JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) A human-readable, open standard, text-based file format for data interchange. It is typically used to represent simple data structures and associative arrays, and is language- independent. Keyhole Markup Language (KML) A file format used to display geographic data in an Earth browser, for example, Google Maps. The format uses an XML-based structure (tag-based structure with nested elements and attributes). Tags are case-sensitive. Link-Time Code Generation (LTCG) A method for the linker to optimize code (for size and/or speed) after compilation has occurred. The compiled code is turned not into actual code, but instead into an intermediate language form (IL, but not to be confused with .NET IL which has a different purpose). The LTCG then, unlike the compiler, can see the whole body of code in all object files and be able to optimize the result more effectively. Message Passing Interface (MPI) An interface used to pass information between computing cores in parallel simulations. One example is the migration of individuals from one geographic location to another within EMOD simulations. microsolver A microsolver is a type of \u201cminiature model\u201d that operates within the framework of EMOD to compute a particular set of parameters. Each microsolver, in effect, is creating a microsimulation in order to accurately capture the dynamics of that particular aspect of the model. Monte Carlo Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a class of computational algorithms utilizing repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Monte Carlo simulations create probability distributions for possible outcome values, which provides a more realistic way of describing uncertainty in variables. monolithic build A single EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) with no DLLs that includes all components as part of Eradication.exe itself. You can still use EMODules with the monolithic build; for example, a custom reporter is a common type of EMODule. View the documentation on EMODules and emodules_map.json for more information about creation and use of EMODules. node A grid size that is used for modeling geographies. Within EMOD, a node is a geographic region containing simulated individuals. Individuals migrate between nodes either temporarily or permanently using mobility patterns driven by local, regional, and long- distance transportation. node-targeted intervention An intervention that is distributed to a geographical node rather than to a single individual. One example is larvicides, which affect all mosquitoes living and feeding within a given node. output report A file that is the output from an EMOD simulation. Output reports are in JSON, CSV, or binary file format. You must pass the data from an output report to graphing software if you want to visualize the output of a simulation. overlay file An additional configuration, campaign, or demographic file that overrides the default parameter values in the primary file. Separating the parameters into multiple files is primarily used for testing a nd experimentation. In the case of configuration and campaign files, the files can use an arbitrary hierarchical structure to organize parameters into logical groups. Configuration and campaign files must be flattened into a single file before running a simulation. preview Software that undergoes a shorter testing cycle in order to make it available more quickly. Previews may contain software defects that could result in unexpected behavior. Use EMOD previews at your own discretion. regression test A test to verify that existing EMOD functionality works with new updates, typically used to refer to one of a set of scenarios included in the EMOD bundle and located in the Regression subdirectory of the bundle. Directory names of each subdirectory in Regression describe the main regression attributes, for example, \u201c1_Generic_Seattle_MultiNode\u201d. Also can refer to the process of regression testing of software. release Software that includes new functionality, scientific tutorials leveraging new or existing functionality, and/or bug fixes that have been thoroughly tested so that any defects have been fixed before release. EMOD releases undergo full regression testing. reporter Functionality that extracts simulation data, aggregates it, and saves it as an output report . EMOD provides several built-in reporters for outputting data from simulations and you also have the ability to create a custom reporter. scenario A collection of input, configuration, and campaign files that describes a real-world example of a disease outbreak and interventions. Many scenarios are included with EMOD source installations or are available in the Regression directory of the EMOD GitHub repository. The tutorials describe how to run simulations using these scenarios to learn more about epidemiology and disease modeling. schema A text or JSON file that can be generated from the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) that defines all configuration and campaign parameters. simulation An EMOD software execution performed by the kernel. Each simulation has an associated set of files that control the inputs, configuration, and campaign. simulation type The disease or disease class to model. EMOD supports the following simulation types for modeling a variety of diseases: Generic disease (GENERIC_SIM) Vector-borne diseases (VECTOR_SIM) Malaria (MALARIA_SIM) Tuberculosis (TB_SIM) Sexually transmitted infections (STI_SIM) HIV (HIV_SIM) solvers Solvers are used to find computational solutions to problems. In simulations, they can be used, for example, to determine the time of the next simulation step, or to compute the states of a model at particular time steps. Standard Template Library (STL) A library that contains a set of common C++ classes (including generic algorithms and data structures) that are independent of container and implemented as templates, which enables compile-time polymorphism (often more efficient than run-time polymorphism). For more information and discussion of STL, see Wikipedia . state transition event A change in state (e.g. healthy to infected, undiagnosed to positive diagnosis, or birth) that may trigger a subsequent action, often an intervention. \u201cCampaign events\u201d should not be confused with state transition events. time step A discrete number of hours or days in which the \u201csimulation states\u201d of all \u201csimulation objects\u201d (interventions, infections, immune systems, or individuals) are updated in a simulation. Each time step will complete processing before launching the next one. For example, a time step would process the migration data for populations moving between nodes via rail, airline, and road. The migration of individuals between nodes is the last step of the time step after updating states. tutorial A set of instructions in the documentation to learn more about epidemiology and disease modeling. Tutorials are based on real-world scenarios and demonstrate the mechanics of the the model. Each tutorial consists of one or more scenarios. working directory The directory that contains the configuration and campaign files for a simulation. You must be in this directory when you invoke Eradication.exe at the command line to run a simulation. Epidemiology terms \u00b6 The following terms are used to describe general concepts and processes in the field of epidemiology and disease modeling. antigen A substance that is capable of inducing a specific immune response and that evokes the production of one or more antibodies. Clausius-Clayperon relation A way of characterizing a transition between two phases of matter; provides a method to find a relationship between temperature and pressure along phase boundaries. Frequently used in meteorology and climatology to describe the behavior of water vapor. See Wikipedia - Clausius-Clayperon relation for more information. deterministic Characterized by the output being fully determined by the parameter values and the initial conditions. Given the same inputs, a deterministic model will always produce the same output. diffusive migration The diffusion of people in and out of nearby nodes by foot travel. epitope The portion of an antigen that the immune system recognizes. An epitope is also called an antigenic determinant. Euler method Used in mathematics and computational science, this method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations with a given initial value. exp( The exponential function, , where is the number (approximately 2.718281828) such that the function is its own derivative. The exponential function is used to model a relationship in which a constant change in the independent variable gives the same proportional change (i.e. percentage increase or decrease) in the dependent variable. The function is often written as . The graph of is upward-sloping and increases faster as increases. herd immunity The resistance to the spread of a contagious disease within a population that results if a sufficiently high proportion of individuals are immune to the disease, especially through vaccination. incidence The rate of new cases of a disease during a specified time period. This is a measure of the risk of contracting a disease. Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification System A system based on the concept that native vegetation is a good expression of climate. Thus, climate zone boundaries have been selected with vegetation distribution in mind. It combines average annual and monthly temperatures and precipitation, and the seasonality of precipitation. EMOD has several options for configuring the climate, namely air temperature, rainfall, and humidity. One option utilizes Input Files that associate geographic nodes with Koppen climate indices. The modified Koppen classification uses three letters to divide the world into five major climate regions (A, B, C, D, and E) based on average annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly temperature. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on temperature and precipitation. While the Koppen system does not take such things as temperature extremes, average cloud cover, number of days with sunshine, or wind into account, it is a good representation of our earth\u2019s climate. loss to follow-up (LTFU) Patients who at one point were actively participating in disease treatment or clinical research, but have become lost either by error or by becoming unreachable at the point of follow-up. ordinary differential equation (ODE) A differential equation containing one or more functions of one independent variable and its derivatives. prevalence The rate of all cases of a disease during a specified time period. This is a measure of how widespread a disease is. reproductive number In a fully susceptible population, the basic reproductive number R:sub:0is the number of new cases generated by one infectious case over the course of the infectious period. The effective reproductive number takes into account non-susceptible individuals. routine immunization (RI) The standard practice of vaccinating the majority of susceptible people in a population against vaccine-preventable diseases. scenario A real-world or hypothetical situation that demonstrates or represents disease dynamics. stochastic Characterized by having a random probability distribution that may be analyzed statistically but not predicted precisely. subpatent When an individual is infected but asymptomatic, so the infection is not readily detectable. SEIR model A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the following five states: susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered. SEIRS model A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the following five states: susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, and susceptible. SI model A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the following five states: susceptible and infectious. SIR model A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the following five states: susceptible, infectious, and recovered. SIRS model A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the following five states: susceptible, infectious, recovered, and susceptible. SIS model A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the following five states: susceptible, infectious, and susceptible. supplemental immunization activity (SIA) In contrast to routine immunization (RI) , SIAs are large-scale operations with a goal of delivering vaccines to every household. WAIFW matrix A matrix of values that describes the rate of transmission between different population groups. WAIFW is an abbrevation for Who Acquires Infection From Whom. Weibull distribution A probability distribution often used in EMOD and that requires both a shape parameter and a scale parameter. The shape parameter governs the shape of the density function. When the shape parameter is equal to 1, it is an exponential distribution. For shape parameters above 1, it forms a unimodal (hump-shaped) density function. As the shape parameter becomes large, the function forms a sharp peak. The inverse of the shape parameter is sometimes referred to here as the \u201cheterogeneity\u201d of the distribution (heterogeneity = 1/shape), because it can be helpful to think about the degree of heterogeneity of draws from the distribution, especially for hump-shaped functions with heterogeneity values between 0 and 1 (i.e., shape parameters greater than 1). The scale parameter shifts the distribution from left to right. When heterogeneity is small (i.e., the shape parameter is large), the scale parameter sets the location of the sharp peak. Malaria and vector terms \u00b6 The following terms are used to describe the biological processes involved in malaria and other vector-borne diseases. circumsporozoite protein (CSP) One of two proteins (the other being thrombospondin-related adhesive protein) involved in sporozoite recognition of host cells in malaria. cohort model A vector model that tracks properties of mosquito \u201ccohorts\u201d, for example, population, age, gender, fertility, etc. cytokine Cytokines are small secreted proteins that are released by cells, and have specific effects on interactions and communications between cells. They are especially important in the immune system, and can function in inflammatory (and anti-inflammatory) response. CRISPR A genome-editing technique that utilizes the CRISPR/Cas9 system (a prokaryotic immune system) that can be used to splice DNA sequences in very specific target locations, enabling the precise insertion or removal of genes of interest. entomological inoculation rate (EIR) The commonly-used measure of the intensity of malaria transmission. EIR is equal to the number of mosquito bites per night times the proportion of those bites that test positive for sporozoites. gametocyte The male and female sexual forms of the blood-stage malaria parasite. During blood-feeding, gametocytes are taken up into the mosquito mid-gut where they commence the mosquito-phase of the parasite life cycle. gene drive mosquito Gene drive is a genetic technique that promotes the inheritance of particular genes or specific genetic elements. In mosquitoes, approaches are being tested that work to suppress the spread of malaria by creating mosquito lines through fertility suppression, driving-Y chromosomes, or express genes that limit malaria transmission. gonotrophic A female mosquito\u2019s feeding and egg-laying cycle, where the duration is defined as the average number of days that gravid mosquitoes take to oviposit after taking a blood meal. hepatocyte The cell type that comprises liver tissue. homing endonuclease gene (HEG) A \u201cselfish\u201d genetic element that can spread through the mosquito population even at a cost to the host. The HEG allele status is a tracked property of mosquitoes. Large numbers of HEG- positive mosquitoes may be introduced into the simulation by a MosquitoRelease intervention. individual mosquito model A vector model simulation where every individual mosquito in the population is modeled, as well as a simulation of a sampled subset of mosquitoes to represent the population as the whole. indoor residual spraying (IRS) The process of spraying insecticide on the interior surfaces of dwellings in order to repel or kill mosquitoes. insecticide-treated nets (ITN) Bednets hung over sleeping areas that are treated with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and kill those that land on them. larval habitat Mosquito larval ecology includes several habitat types including brackish swamp, constant, human population, temporary rainfall, and semi-permanent water vegetation. larvicide A node-targeted intervention that may be configured to have a direct killing effect on the larval population and a temporary reduction on available larval habitat. mass drug administration (MDA) The treatment of an entire population in a geographic area with a curative dose of an antimalarial drug without first testing for infection, and regardless of the presence of symptoms. merozoite The malaria parasite stage that invades red blood cells. After each cycle of asexual reproduction within the infected red blood cell, merozoites are released into the bloodstream to invade new red blood cells. merozoites see \u201cmerozoite\u201d merozoite surface protein (MSP) A type of protein integral to red blood cell invasion by malaria parasites that is an important target of the human immune response. oviposition to deposit or lay eggs. pre-erythrocytic Stages of a malaria parasite that occur before the red blood cells are invaded. This includes the period starting from inoculation with sporozoites, through the liver-stage multiplication, up to infected hepatocyte rupture, and the first invasion of erythrocytes by merozoites. pre-erythrocytic vaccine (PEV) A vaccine targeted at the earliest stage of malaria parasite development, namely before the blood-stage infection. Other vaccines target the asexual and sexual stages of the parasite. Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) A protein encoded by the malaria parasite and expressed on the surface of infected red blood cells. PfEMP1 adheres to various human receptors, allowing sequestration of parasitized red blood cells and avoidance of clearance in the spleen. PfEMP1 is an important antigenic target of the human adapted immune response. It exhibits a high degree of antigenic variation via a genetic switching mechanism evolved to escape immune pressure. schizont Cells formed during the asexual stage of the life cycle of sporozoan protozoans, such as the malaria parasite. spatial repellent An intervention that may be individually-distributed (protective indoors and outdoors), or node-distributed at the community-level, that repels mosquitoes from biting. sporogony The asexual process of spore formation in parasitic sporozoans. sporozoite a motile, spore-like stage of the malaria parasite that is the infectious agent introduced into the host. sugar-baited trap Bait stations, often placed inside houses, that have an attractive and toxic sugar used to attract and kill sugar-feeding male and female mosquitoes. superinfection The simultaneous infection with multiple strains of the same pathogen. transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV) A vaccine that blocks gametocytes from infected humans by producing viable sporozoites in mosquitoes. Also referred to as a \u201csexual-stage\u201d vaccine, since vaccines in this class block gametocytes from infected humans by producing viable sporozoites in mosquitoes. vaccine intervention types In EMOD, vaccine intervention types are either \u201cAcquisitionBlocking\u201d, \u201cTransmissionBlocking\u201d or \u201cMortalityBlocking\u201d. For example, \u201cmode-of-action\u201d, \u201ctargeted parasite stages\u201d, (such as pre-erythrocytic, asexual, or sexual), etc. vector Insect or other living carrier that transmits an infectious agent. The vector life cycle and feeding cycle in the model are described in the article Eckhoff, Malaria Journal 2011, 10:303 . vectorial capacity The daily rate of all mosquitoes that would be infected after biting a single infectious host. This measure can be used to describe the transmission intensity of malaria, and serves as a rate at which future infections arise from a currently infected host. vector model The vector model includes both a cohort model and an individual mosquito model . The model is a closed-loop feeding cycle where successful animal feeds (both indoors and outdoors) produce eggs, larva, vector mating, and then, adult mosquitoes. The vector model inherits the same human- infection model structure from the generic simulation type: uninfected, latent incubation, infectious, multiple immune variables, and superinfection. However, the transmission of infections is not between individual humans, but rather via the human-to-vector and vector- to-human pathways. Wolbachia This is a genus of bacteria that infects many arthopod species (especially insects). It has been discovered that insects infected with Wolbachia have increased resistance to viral or other parasitic infections. Work is underway to determine if strains of modified Wolbachia can be used to control malaria, by effectively preventing mosquitoes from becoming infected with Plasmodium parasites.", "tags": "", "title": "Glossary \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./hint-scaling.html", "text": "Heterogeneity and transmission scaling \u00b6 This topic describes the mathematics governing the Heterogeneous Intra-Node Transmission (HINT) feature.

One file contains default campaign settings and an overlay file contains additional parameters or different parameter values that override the values in the default file. This topic describes how to set up the default and overlay file and flatten them into a single file before running a simulation. Overlay files allow you to easily separate a subset of parameters that are of particular interest from the rest of the parameters needed to run a simulation. You can easily modify the parameters in the overlay file without needing to maintain a complete campaign file. This can be especially helpful when you want to experiment with different interventions without modifying the rest of the settings. You can have one default file and many different overlay files for different intervention settings. It also allows you to easily update the default values across multiple simulations. In addition to being used for model experimentation, overlay files are used when testing the software functionality after making source code changes. If you run the EMOD regression tests using regression_test.py, campaign files will be flattened as part of those tests. However, this may take several hours if run locally. More guidance on modifying the EMOD source code is in the \u201cAdvance the model\u201d section. Follow the steps below to quickly flatten campaign files. Create the default campaign file in JSON. You may, though it is not required, organize the parameters into logical categories of nested JSON objects to make managing the parameters easier.

It is hierarchically organized into logical groups of parameters that can have arbitrary levels of nesting. For some interventions, there can be a very complex hierarchical structure, including recursion. This framework enables rigorous testing of possible control strategies to determine which events or combination of events will best aid in the elimination of disease for specific geographic locations. For a complete list of campaign parameters that are available to use with this simulation type and more detail about the campaign file structure, see Campaign parameters . For more information about JSON, see EMOD parameter reference . For the interventions to take place, the campaign file must be in the same directory as the configuration file and you must set the configuration parameters Enable_Interventions to 1 and Campaign_Filename to the name of the campaign file. The EMOD Regression directory contains many different subdirectories that contain configuration, campaign, and other associated files to run simulations that represent real-world scenarios. Within the each subdirectory, there is usually a single campaign file (campaign.json), though some directories also include a campaign overlay file (campaign_overrides.json), which has been created by combining campaign_overrides.json with one of the default files in Regression/defaults . The naming of these files is an arbitrary convention used at IDM; you may name this files anything you choose. See Use campaign overlay files for more information flattening two campaign files. Although you can create campaign files entirely from scratch, it is often easier to start from an existing campaign file and modify it to meet your needs. The simplest method is to edit the parameters or parameter values in the JSON file in any text editor. You may also create or modify the files using a scripting language, as with configuration files. See Create a configuration file for examples. The following is an example of campaign file that has two events (SimpleVaccine and Outbreak) that occur in all nodes at day 1 and day 30, respectively. Each event contains an event coordinator that describes who receives the intervention (everyone, with the vaccine repeated three times) and the configuration for the intervention itself. Note that the nested JSON elements have been organized to best illustrate their hierarchy, but that many files in the Regression directory list the parameters and nested objects differently. { \"Campaign_Name\" : \"Vaccine\" , \"Use_Defaults\" : 1 , \"Events\" : [ { \"Event_Name\" : \"SimpleVaccine\" , \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeSetAll\" }, \"Start_Day\" : 1 , \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" , \"Event_Coordinator_Config\" : { \"Demographic_Coverage\" : 0.5 , \"Number_Repetitions\" : 3 , \"Target_Demographic\" : \"Everyone\" , \"Timesteps_Between_Repetitions\" : 7 , \"class\" : \"StandardInterventionDistributionEventCoordinator\" , \"Intervention_Config\" : { \"Cost_To_Consumer\" : 10 , \"Waning_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"WaningEffectMapLinear\" , \"Initial_Effect\" : 1.0 , \"Expire_At_Durability_Map_End\" : 0 , \"Durability_Map\" : { \"Times\" : [ 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 ], \"Values\" : [ 0.9 , 0.3 , 0.9 , 0.6 , 1.0 ] } }, \"Vaccine_Take\" : 1 , \"Vaccine_Type\" : \"AcquisitionBlocking\" , \"class\" : \"SimpleVaccine\" } }, }, { \"Event_Name\" : \"Outbreak\" , \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeSetAll\" }, \"Start_Day\" : 30 , \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" , \"Event_Coordinator_Config\" : { \"Demographic_Coverage\" : 0.001 , \"Target_Demographic\" : \"Everyone\" , \"class\" : \"StandardInterventionDistributionEventCoordinator\" , \"Intervention_Config\" : { \"Antigen\" : 0 , \"Genome\" : 0 , \"Outbreak_Source\" : \"PrevalenceIncrease\" , \"class\" : \"OutbreakIndividual\" } } } ] } Multiple interventions \u00b6 When creating multiple interventions, either of the same type or different types, they will generally be distributed independently without regard to whether a person has already received another intervention. Warning The event containing the outbreak \u201cintervention\u201d must be the last one listed in the campaign file or none of the disease control interventions will take place. For example, say you create two SimpleBednet interventions and both interventions have Demographic_Coverage set to 0.5 (50% demographic coverage). This value is the probability that each individual in the target population will receive the intervention. It does not guarantee that the exact fraction of the target population set by Demographic_Coverage receives the intervention. By default, each individual in the simulation will have a 50% chance of receiving a bednet in both of the distributions and the two distributions will be independent. Therefore, each individual has a 75% chance of receiving at least one bednet.

Two forms of the simulation configuration file are used: a flattened version and a hierarchical version. This topic describes how to create a configuration file of other form. The EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) and Eradication binary requires a flattened version of the simulation configuration file. The hierarchical version allows you to organize parameters into logical groups, making them easier to manage. If you use hierarchical configuration files, you must flatten them prior to running a simulation. The EMOD Regression directory contains many different subdirectories that contain configuration, campaign, and other associated files to run simulations that represent real-world scenarios. Within the each subdirectory, there is usually a hierarchical overlay file (param_overrides.json) and a flattened file (config.json), which has been created by combining param_overrides.json with one of the default files in Regression/defaults . The default files are also organized hierarchically. The naming of these files is an arbitrary convention used at IDM; you may name this files anything you choose.

For a complete list of configuration parameters that are available to use with this simulation type, see Configuration parameters . For more information about JSON, see EMOD parameter reference . Flattened configuration file \u00b6 A flattened configuration file is generally a single-depth JSON file with configuration parameters listed alphabetically. This is the configuration file format that Eradication.exe requires for running simulations. However, there may be some hierarchical elements in the flattened version. For example, Vector_Species_Params and Malaria_Drug_Params have nested JSON objects.

As a way of sorting parameters into logical groups, the parameters can be contained inside nested JSON objects. The names you use to create these logical categories are unimportant; the scripts used to flatten the files will search through the hierarchies and retain only the \u201cleaf\u201d values in the resulting flattened file.

Any of the configuration files in the Regression directory may be used; in particular the Regression/defaults directory contains hierarchical configuration files with the common parameter settings used with different simulation types. The simplest method is to use a text editor to directly edit the parameters or parameter values in the JSON file. However, while direct editing of files may be sufficient for small and infrequent changes, you will likely find that scripting tools are more powerful and reliable for both creating and modifying files. The following example shows how to read a configuration file to a Python dictionary, modify a parameter, and write it back out to the file: import json # load the current config.json config_file = open ( \"config.json\" ) config_json = json . load ( config_file ) config_file . close () # modify one of the parameter values, e.g. \"base_infectivity\" config_json [ \"parameters\" ][ \"base_infectivity\" ] = 0.5 # write the modified config file modified_file = open ( \"modified_config.json\" , \"w\" ) json . dump ( config_json , modified_file , sort_keys = True , indent = 4 ) modified_file . close () The following example shows how to modify a configuration file in MATLAB: addpath Matlab addpath Matlab \\ test % load the simulation configuration file into MATLAB structure configjson = loadJson ( \" config . json \" ); % modify one of the values configjson . parameters . Base_Infectivity = 08.5 ; % save the new configuration to file saveJson ( \" modified_config . json \" , configjson ); Generate a list of all available parameters (a schema) Perform a parameter sweep Use configuration overlay files Malaria or vector configuration tips", "tags": "", "title": "Create a configuration file \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./howto-custom-reporter.html", "text": "Custom reporters \u00b6 Reporters extract simulation data, aggregate it, and output it to a file known as an output report . You can process the report data using tools, such as Python or MATLAB, to create graphs and charts for analysis. EMOD provides built-in reporters that are part of the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) and can be enabled or disabled by setting parameters in the configuration file . See Output report structure for a list of the reports that are available using built-in reporters. In addition, you can use custom reporters that extract data from the simulation and aren\u2019t part of the Eradication.exe. A custom reporter is an EMODule that you plug in to EMOD. Custom reporters are not supported for CentOS on Azure. There are several reporters in the GitHub reporters directory that you can use. You may also want to build your own custom reporter to create a new output report. The Eradication.exe must load the reporter when running a simulation to use it. If it is loaded, the output report will be automatically generated at the end of the simulation. There are three ways to specify their location so Eradication.exe can load them. Eradication.exe attempts to load the file using the following methods, in the order listed: Define the location of the dynamic link library (DLL) in a JSON-formatted file (emodules_map.json). Point to the location using the --dll-path command-line option when invoking Eradication.exe. Place the DLL in the working directory . JSON file \u00b6 First, Eradication.exe looks for an emodules_map.json file in the working directory. This map file lists specific reporter DLLs and their exact location. This is useful if you want to store all custom reporters in the same directory, but only want certain reporters to be used with each simulation. The emodules_map.json file has three sections: diseases, interventions and reporters. Each section is a JSON array and contains the path to each EMODule in the array. Although reporter EMODules are the only type currently supported, empty disease and intervention sections must be included. You must use either a double backslash (\\) or a single forward slash (/) to represent a single backslash for the path. For example: { \"disease_plugins\" : [ ], \"interventions\" : [ ], \"reporter_plugins\" : [ \"C:\\\\src\\\\EMOD\\\\x64\\\\Release\\\\emodules\\\\reporter_plugins\\\\libreportpluginbasic.dll\" ] } Command-line option \u00b6 If a map file is not provided, you can include the --dll-path option when you invoke Eradication.exe. It must point to a directory with a reporter_plugins subdirectory that contains the reporters. The name of the directory does not matter, but the reporter must be in a subdirectory named reporter_plugins. Note that this method will load all reporters in the root directory specified. If you build custom reporters as described here, the DLLs will be saved to the following directories, depending on the build configuration: <EMOD source directory path>x64Releasereporter_plugins <EMOD source directory path>x64Debugreporter_plugins Therefore, if you do not move your reports, you will set --dll-path to one of the following paths: <EMOD source directory path>x64Release <EMOD source directory path>x64Debug For more information on EMOD command-line options, see Run a simulation using the command line . Working directory \u00b6 Finally, if neither the the map file or the command-line option are provided, Eradication.exe looks for the reporter plug-in in the current working directory.", "tags": "", "title": "Custom reporters \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./howto-demographics-heterogeneity.html", "text": "Configure heterogeneity using individual and node properties \u00b6 Demographics files can be used to add heterogeneity to a population. You can define property values for accessibility, age, geography, risk, and other properties and assign these values to individuals or nodes in the simulation. For more information about the parameters and structure of demographics files, see Demographics parameters . These properties are most commonly used to target (or avoid targeting) particular nodes or individuals with interventions. For example, you might want to put individuals into different age bins and then target interventions to individuals in a particular age bin. Another common use is to configure treatment coverage to be higher for nodes that are easy to access and lower for nodes that are difficult to access. For more information on targeting interventions to particular nodes or individuals, see Target interventions to nodes or groups . For the generic simulation type, you can also configure heterogeneous transmission between individuals with different property values. For more information, see Configure heterogeneous disease transmission . For other simulation types, transmission is configured using mechanistic parameter settings. This topic describes how to define individual properties and assign different values to individuals in a simulation. However, with the exception of setting up age bins, you can use the same process to configure heterogeneity using NodeProperties . To see all individual and node property parameters, see NodeProperties and IndividualProperties . Create individual properties other than age \u00b6 Assigning property values, such as accessibility or risk, to individuals uses the IndividualProperties parameter in the demographics file. See Demographics parameters for a list of supported properties. The values you assign to properties are user-defined and can be applied to individuals in all nodes or only in particular nodes in a simulation. In the demographics file, add the IndividualProperties parameter and set it to an empty array. If you want the values to apply to all nodes, add it in the Defaults section; if you want the values to be applied to specific nodes, add it to the Nodes section. In the array, add an empty JSON object. Within it, do the following: Add the Property parameter and set it to one of the supported values. Add the Values parameter and set it to an array of possible values that can be assigned to individuals. You can define any value here. Add the Initial_Distribution parameter and set it to an array of numbers that add up to 1. This configures the initial distribution of the values assigned to individuals in one or all nodes. To define how individuals transition from one property value to another, add the Transitions parameter and set it to it an empty array. Within it, do the following: Add an empty JSON object and set parameters that define the value that individuals transition from, the value they transition to, the event that triggers the transition, the probability of transition, and more. See doc: parameter-demographics for a list of supported Transitions parameters and values. If you want to add another property and associated values, add a new JSON object in the IndividualProperties array as above. Note Multiple properties must be defined in one file. They can be defined in either the base layer demographics file or an overlay file, but they cannot be split between the files. The maximum number of property types that can be added is two. Create properties for age ranges \u00b6 Creating properties based on age ranges works a little differently than other properties. Age_Bin is tied to the simulated age of an individual rather than being an independent property. Some of its characteristics, such as initial distribution and transitions, are dependent on information from the demographics file and EMOD that manages individual aging during the simulation. The Transitions array is not required and other parameters and structures in IndividualProperties are slightly different. In the demographics file, add the IndividualProperties parameter and set it to an empty array. If you want the values to apply to all nodes, add it in the Defaults section; if you want the values to be applied to specific nodes, add it to the Nodes section. In the array, add an empty JSON object. Within it, do the following: Add the Property parameter and set it to \u201cAge_Bin\u201d. Add the Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years parameter and set it to an array that contains a comma- delimited list of integers in ascending order that define the boundaries used for each of the age bins, in years. The first number must always be 0 (zero) to indicate the age at birth and the last number must be -1 to indicate the maximum age in the simulation. The example below shows how to set up several property values based on disease risk and physical place, and how to move individuals among these values. It also defines three age bins: 0 to 5 years, older than 5 to 13, and older than 13 to the maximum age. { \"Defaults\" : { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"Property\" : \"Risk\" , \"Values\" : [ \"Low\" , \"Medium\" , \"High\" ], \"Initial_Distribution\" : [ 0.7 , 0.2 , 0.1 ], \"Transitions\" : [{ \"From\" : \"High\" , \"To\" : \"Medium\" , \"Type\" : \"At_Age\" , \"Coverage\" : 1 , \"Probability_Per_Timestep\" : 0.3 , \"Timestep_Restriction\" : 20 , \"Age_In_Years\" : 5 , \"Timesteps_Until_Reversion\" : 0 }, { \"From\" : \"Medium\" , \"To\" : \"Low\" , \"Type\" : \"At_Age\" , \"Coverage\" : 1 , \"Probability_Per_Timestep\" : 0.3 , \"Timestep_Restriction\" : 20 , \"Age_In_Years\" : 12 , \"Timesteps_Until_Reversion\" : 0 }] }, { \"Property\" : \"Place\" , \"Values\" : [ \"Community\" , \"School\" , \"Work\" , \"Vacation\" ], \"Initial_Distribution\" : [ 0.3 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.1 ], \"Transitions\" : [{ \"From\" : \"School\" , \"To\" : \"Vacation\" , \"Type\" : \"At_Timestep\" , \"Coverage\" : 1 , \"Timestep_Restriction\" : { \"Start\" : 20 }, \"Age_In_Years_Restriction\" : {}, \"Probability_Per_Timestep\" : 1 , \"Timesteps_Until_Reversion\" : 20 }] }, { \"Property\" : \"Age_Bin\" , \"Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years\" : [ 0 , 5 , 13 , - 1 ], \"Transitions\" : [] }] } }", "tags": "", "title": "Configure heterogeneity using individual and node properties \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./howto-demographics-overlay.html", "text": "Use demographics overlay files \u00b6 You can use multiple demographic files when setting up a simulation. The \u201cbase layer\u201d file contains default parameter settings and one or more overlay files contains additional parameters or different parameter values that override the values in the default file. This topic describes how to set up the base layer and overlay files. Demographic overlay files allow you to do the following: Separate different sets of parameters and values into individual overlays (for example, to separate those that are useful for specific diseases into different overlay files) Add new parameters for a simulation into an overlay for easier prototyping Override certain parameters of interest in an overlay Override certain parameters for a particular sub-region Simulating subsets of a larger region for which input data files have been constructed Select the demographics file to use as the base layer file. All nodes to be included in the simulation must be listed in this file. In the metadata, make note of the IdReference value. You may change this value if you desire, but all input files for a simulation must have the same IdReference value. For more information about this parameter and the structure of demographics files in general, see Demographics parameters . Create one or more overlay files. Keep the following things in mind: In the metadata, the value for IdReference must match the value in the base layer file and all other input data files. Any nodes listed in an overlay but not in the base layer will not be simulated. If the demographics files include any JSON array elements, the entire array is overridden. You cannot add or remove individual elements in an array using an overlay file. Overriding a parameter value on a node will not affect the other parameter values applied to that node. Values set in the Defaults section of an overlay will be applied to all nodes listed in that file, not all nodes in the entire simulation. Therefore, an overlay file that includes a Defaults section but no Nodes section will not have any effect. Place all demographics files in the directory where the other input data files are stored. In the configuration file , set Demographics_Filenames to an array that contains a comma-delimited list of demographics files, listing the base layer file first. An example base layer demographics file and an overlay file is below. You can see that the overlay adds the TransmissionMatrix for Heterogeneous Intra-Node Transmission (HINT) to only three of the five nodes (which correspond to Washington state counties). { \"Metadata\" : { \"Author\" : \"ewenger\" , \"NodeCount\" : 5 , \"Tool\" : \"table_to_demographics.py\" , \"IdReference\" : \"SampleContent\" , \"DateCreated\" : \"2013-08-01 15:37:16.853000\" }, \"Defaults\" : { \"NodeAttributes\" : { \"BirthRate_DESCRIPTION\" : \"Replacement of stable age distribution: Birth_Rate_Dependence=DEMOGRAPHIC_DEP_RATE (i.e. 14-45 year-old PossibleMothers)\" , \"BirthRate\" : 0.00017675 , \"Airport\" : 0 , \"Region\" : 1 , \"Altitude\" : 0 , \"Seaport\" : 0 }, \"IndividualAttributes\" : { \"AgeDistribution_DESCRIPTION\" : \"Box between age 0 and 60 years: Age_Initialization_Distribution_Type=DISTRIBUTION_SIMPLE\" , \"AgeDistributionFlag\" : 1 , \"AgeDistribution1\" : 0 , \"AgeDistribution2\" : 21900 , \"PrevalenceDistribution_DESCRIPTION\" : \"No initial infections\" , \"PrevalenceDistributionFlag\" : 0 , \"PrevalenceDistribution1\" : 0 , \"PrevalenceDistribution2\" : 0 , \"RiskDistributionFlag\" : 0 , \"RiskDistribution1\" : 1 , \"RiskDistribution2\" : 0 , \"ImmunityDistributionFlag\" : 0 , \"ImmunityDistribution1\" : 1 , \"ImmunityDistribution2\" : 0 , \"MigrationHeterogeneityDistributionFlag\" : 0 , \"MigrationHeterogeneityDistribution1\" : 1 , \"MigrationHeterogeneityDistribution2\" : 0 , \"MortalityDistribution_DESCRIPTION\" : \"WA state (1999-2010).

A standard Git clone of the repository will only retrieve the metadata for these files managed with LFS. To retrieve the actual data, follow the steps below. Install the Git LFS plugin, if it is not already installed. For Windows users, download the plugin from https://git-lfs.github.com . For CentOS on Azure users, the plugin is included with the PrepareLinuxEnvironment.sh script. Using a Git client or Command Prompt window, clone the input data repository to retrieve the metadata: git clone https : // github . com / InstituteforDiseaseModeling / EMOD - InputData . git Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the metadata for the input data files. Cache the actual data on your local machine: git lfs fetch Replace the metadata in the files with the actual contents: git lfs checkout Specify input files in the configuration file \u00b6 Follow the steps below to specify which input files to use in a simulation. Only the demographics file is required, though additional files are generally needed for a realistic simulation. Place all input files for a simulation in the same directory. You will specify this directory when you run a simulation. See Run simulations for more information. In your configuration file , specify the path to each of these files, relative to the directory above, in the appropriate parameter. Generally, these parameters are appended with \u201c_Filename\u201d or \u201c_Filenames\u201d. For example, the example below shows the relevant portion of a configuration file. See :doc : parameter-configuration for a complete list of the parameters. { \"parameters\" : { \"Air_Temperature_Filename\" : \"Namawala_single_node_air_temperature_daily.bin\" , \"Air_Temperature_Offset\" : 0 , \"Air_Temperature_Variance\" : 2 , \"Base_Rainfall\" : 100 , \"Campaign_Filename\" : \"campaign.json\" , \"Climate_Model\" : \"CLIMATE_BY_DATA\" , \"Climate_Update_Resolution\" : \"CLIMATE_UPDATE_DAY\" , \"Config_Name\" : \"VectorAndMalaria_5_Namawala_Vector_ITNs\" , \"Demographics_Filenames\" : [ \"Namawala_single_node_demographics.json\" ], \"Geography\" : \"Namawala\" , \"Land_Temperature_Filename\" : \"Namawala_single_node_land_temperature_daily.bin\" , \"Land_Temperature_Offset\" : 0 , \"Land_Temperature_Variance\" : 2 , \"Load_Balance_Filename\" : \"\" , \"Rainfall_Filename\" : \"Namawala_single_node_rainfall_daily.bin\" , \"Rainfall_In_mm_To_Fill_Swamp\" : 1000.0 , \"Rainfall_Scale_Factor\" : 1 , \"Relative_Humidity_Filename\" : \"Namawala_single_node_relative_humidity_daily.bin\" , \"Relative_Humidity_Scale_Factor\" : 1 , \"Relative_Humidity_Variance\" : 0.05 } } Modify demographics files \u00b6 The demographics files provided by IDM generally contain information about prevalence, immunity, risk, population size, and more for a geographic region. However, you will almost certainly want to modify the file to provide more detail or to set up groups within a population to more accurately model heterogeneous populations in terms of transmission, group transitions, or targeted interventions. The demographics file is the only required input data file, with one exception. You have the option to run a simulation without a demographics file if you set Enable_Demographics_Builtin to 1 in the configuration file. However, this option is primarily used for software testing. It will not provide meaningful simulation data as it does not represent the population of a real geographic location.

Some are logging or error output files, which you can read about more in Error and logging files . The rest are output reports that contain data from the simulation itself, usually in JSON or CSV format. This topic describes how to parse and use the output reports. By default, the output report InsetChart.json is always produced, which contains per- timestep values accumulated over the simulation in a variety of reporting channels, for example, \u201cNew Infections\u201d, \u201cAdult Vectors\u201d, and \u201cParasite Prevalence\u201d. EMOD provides several other built-in reports that you can produce if you enable them in the configuration file . See Output report structure for additional information about the reports and how to enable them. If none of the built-in output reports provide the data you need, you can use a custom reporter that plugs in to the Eradication.exe as a EMODule Dynamic Link Library (DLL) . For more information, see Custom reporters . In order to interpret the output of EMOD simulations, you will find it useful to parse the output reports into an analyzable structure. For example, you can use a Python or MATLAB script to create graphs and charts for analysis. Use Python to parse data \u00b6 The example below uses the Python package JSON to parse the file and the Python package matplotlib.pyplot to plot the output. This is a very simple example and not likely the most robust or elegant. Be sure to set the actual path to your working directory. import os import json import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # open and parse InsetChart.json ic_json = json . loads ( open ( os . path . join ( WorkingDirectoryLocation , \"output\" , \"InsetChart.json\" ) ) . read () ) ic_json_allchannels = ic_json [ \"Channels\" ] ic_json_birthdata = ic_json [ \"Channels\" ][ \"Births\" ] # plot \"Births\" channel by time step plt . plot ( ic_json_birthdata [ \"Data\" ], 'b-' ) plt . title ( \"Births\" ) plt . show () Use MATLAB to parse data \u00b6 The example below uses the MATLAB toolbox JSONlab to parse an InsetChart.json file and plot one channel.

EMOD does not currently support automated parameter sweeps. However, you can write your own code, such as a Python or MATLAB script, that iterates through the values you want for a particular parameter. This topic describes how to perform a parameter sweep. For example, you can run simulations using a Python script that uses the parameter values specified in a JSON parameter sweep file to iteratively update the configuration or campaign parameter values. The IDM test team performs parameter sweeps as part of regression testing. See the following examples to see how this is implemented. The following JSON example illustrates sweeping through configuration parameter values. { \"sweep\" : { \"path\" : \"43_Vector_Garki_MultiCore_VectorMigration\" , \"param_name\" : \"Run_Number\" , \"param_values\" : [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 55 , 89 , 144 ] } } The following Python example illustrates how to update the configuration file with the above values.

Eradication.exe is \u201csingle threaded\u201d, so it uses only one core for processing. If you run a simulation with multiple geographic nodes using mpiexec instead of invoking Eradication.exe directly, multiple copies of Eradication.exe will be running, with one copy per core processing data for a single node at a time. Message Passing Interface (MPI) communicates between the cores when handling the migration of individuals from one node to another. Although mpiexec can be used to run a simulation in parallel on your local computer, it is more often used to run complex simulations in parallel on an HPC cluster or several linked computers. Mpiexec is part of the Microsoft HPC Pack 2012 SDK (64-bit) installed as a prerequisite for building Eradication.exe from the EMOD source code. See EMOD source code installation for more information. Note If you get an error that the mpiexec command cannot be found, you must add the path to mpiexec to the PATH environment variable. For example, open Control Panel and add the path C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft HPC Pack 2012\\Bin to PATH. Usage \u00b6 Take note of the number of cores on your computer or cluster. If running locally, we recommend running mpiexec with one fewer cores than are available, so one core is reserved for the operating system. The simulation can be run on all available cores and will complete faster, but the desktop will not be responsive. Open a Command Prompt window and navigate to the directory that contains the configuration and campaign files for the simulation. Invoke Eradication.exe using mpiexec as follows, replacing the number of cores, paths, and command options as necessary for your environment. See Run a simulation using the command line for more information about the command options available for use with Eradication.exe. mpiexec -n 3 ..\\Eradication.exe --config config.json --input-path ..\\InputDirectory\\Garki --output-path OutputGarki Mpiexec will start multiple copies of Eradication.exe as specified by -n . Those instances will communicate with each other via MPI. If all cores are on a single computational node or host, they will use internal networking to carry the MPI packets. Note The EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) does NOT use the configuration file parameter Num_Cores , which is used by the infrastructure that runs the simulation, such as an HPC cluster or regression script. You can also link together several computers with MPI using the mpiexec -host option. For example, if you were using six cores on two computers, you could run three copies of Eradication.exe on the first computer, and three more could be run on the second computer. Again, this assumes that each computer has at least three cores.

For example, a single geographical node simulation might use 3 GB with one core in order to run successfully in one minute or less, while another simulation job may require 32 GB in a dual-core system in order to complete in approximately the same amount of time. As your simulations grow, you will likely want to run simulations on an HPC cluster or take other steps to improve performance and reduce processing time. This topic describes many of the steps you can take to speed up EMOD simulations. Parallel processing \u00b6 The EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) is \u201csingle threaded\u201d, meaning that for processing, it will use only one core. However, you can use the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to run multiple copies of Eradication.exe in parallel, either locally or on an HPC cluster. To run a simulation in parallel, you must invoke Eradication.exe with the mpiexec command. For more information, see Run a simulation using mpiexec . Parameter settings \u00b6 You can also set various parameters in the configuration file that will improve performance by scaling down the amount of data used or optimizing data processing. See the parameters listed in the sections below for guidance on making performance adjustments. See Configuration parameters for more information about each of the parameters. Scaling and sampling \u00b6 Simulation_Duration Obviously, simulating a shorter timespan will take less processing time. However, the processing time is often driven by the number of infections or immune updates, so running a simulation after all infections have cleared may not increase processing time much. For more information, see Simulation setup parameters. Individual_Sampling_Type and Base_Individual_Sample_Rate Instead of the default Individual_Sampling_Type setting of \u201cTRACK_ALL\u201d, you can speed up performance by sampling such that each individual object represents more than one person. For example, a simulation with a population of 1 million and sample rate of 0.1 would simulate 100,000 individuals, with each given a weight of 10.Sampling can be fixed at a particular rate or can adapt the rate based on certain criteria, such as age or immune state. However, you should be especially careful not to undersample simulations to the point where they are overly sensitive to rare stochastic events. For more information, see Sampling parameters. Population_Scale_Type and Base_Population_Scale_Factor Alternatively, you can simply reduce the total population of the simulation using Population_Scale_Type set to \u201cFIXED_SCALING\u201d and Base_Population_Scale_Factor set to less than one. For more information, see Scalars and multipliers parameters. Processing \u00b6 Num_Cores For large, spatially distributed simulations, running the intra-node dynamics (for example, infection and immune dynamics) in parallel on multiple cores may be very advantageous. Ideally, the timing would be reduced inversely to the number of cores. However, there are costs to serializing individuals for migration over MPI, as well as considerations for balancing the CPU load on each core. These issues may be mitigated using a load balancing input file that is suitable to the geography being simulated. See Load-balancing file structure for more information. Vector and malaria \u00b6 Simulation_Type \u201cVECTOR_SIM\u201d will run much faster than \u201cMALARIA_SIM\u201d if detailed intra-host dynamics are not \u201crequired. Vector_Sampling_Type and Mosquito_Weight The individual vector simulation (\u201cTRACK_ALL_VECTORS\u201d) will run more slowly than the cohort model (\u201cVECTOR_COMPARTMENTS_NUMBER\u201d). If the individual vector model must be used, you can improve performance by sampling some fraction of all vectors (\u201cSAMPLE_IND_VECTORS\u201d) where each mosquito has a weight configured by Mosquito_Weight , which is analogous to individual human sampling.

The simplest way is to run a simulation at the command line, however that limits you to running one local simulation at a time. Because the EMOD model is stochastic , you must run many simulations before you can interpret the outcome. You may want to use a scripting language like Python or MATLAB or an application like mpiexec to run multiple simulations at once. In addition, if you are modifying the EMOD source code to add functionality to the model, you can run simulations in Visual Studio as part of debugging. This process is described in Run debug simulations in Visual Studio . No matter how you choose to run simulations, you must have a built copy of the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) or Eradication binary, either downloaded directly from GitHub or built from the EMOD source code. See EMOD installation . In addition, you must know the paths to the configuration file and input data files and where you want to store the output files. You will pass this information as arguments to Eradication.exe. Directory structure \u00b6 Although there are many ways you can structure the files needed to run a simulation, we recommend the following to keep your files organized and simplify the file paths set in the configuration file or passed as arguments to Eradication.exe. Place the configuration and campaign files needed for a simulation in the same directory. This is also known as the working directory . However, if you are using overlay files, you may want the default configuration or campaign file in a separate directory so they can be used with different overlay files for other simulations. Place all input data files for a given region in the same directory. Place output for a simulation in a subdirectory of the directory containing configuration and campaign files.

For example, you may want to distribute bednets only to areas where a mosquito-borne disease is endemic or vaccinate only young children who are at highest risk. This topic describes how to distribute interventions to specific geographic nodes or groups of individuals. Target to nodes using Nodeset_Config \u00b6 Targeting geographic nodes with a particular intervention can be controlled by the Nodeset_Config parameter in the campaign file. To distribute the intervention to all nodes, simply set it to \u201cNodeSetAll\u201d. To distribute to a subset of nodes, follow the steps below. In the JSON object for the campaign event, set Nodeset_Config using one of the following two options: Set it to an empty JSON object. Within that object, set the following: Set class to \u201cNodeSetNodeList\u201d. Set Node_List to an array that contains a comma-delimited list of nodes that set where the intervention will be distributed. Set it to an empty JSON object. Within that object, set the following: Set class to \u201cNodeSetPolygon\u201d. Set Polygon_Format to \u201cSHAPE\u201d. Set Vertices to a comma-delimited list of latitude and longitude pairs that define the outer boundary of the region you want to target. The intervention will be distributed to all nodes within the defined bounds. See the example below. { \"Use_Defaults\" : 1 , \"Events\" : [{ \"Event_Name\" : \"Outbreak\" , \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeSetNodeList\" , \"Node_List\" : [ 1 , 3 , 5 ] }, \"Start_Day\" : 10 , \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" }] } Target to nodes or individuals using properties \u00b6 To target interventions to particular individuals or nodes based on their property values, you must first define those properties in the demographics file using IndividualProperties or NodeProperties . Then, in the campaign file, you can target an intervention or outbreak to a group of individuals based on the properties applied to them. See Configure heterogeneity using individual and node properties for instructions on defining properties. Just as defining properties based on age works a little differently than other properties, targeting an intervention to a particular age range works a little differently than targeting an intervention to other properties. To target interventions to properties other than age: In the campaign file, in the event you want to target, set Target_Demographic to \u201cEveryone\u201d. Add the Property_Restrictions parameter and set to an empty array. In that array, add a list of JSON key-value pairs of the property type and value that specifies the groups to apply the intervention to. If the name of the element is not valid, EMOD will ignore the property restriction. To target interventions to age ranges: In the campaign file, in the event you want to target, set Target_Demographic to ExplicitAgeRanges. Add the Target_Age_Min and set to the lower age bound. Add the Target_Age_Max and set to the upper age bound. Both of these values must match one the values listed in Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years in the demographics file. EMOD does not verify this range. The following examples illustrate how to target interventions to different groups. This includes how to configure interventions when there are multiple relevant properties, such as targeting individuals who are both low-risk and in a suburban setting or individuals who are either low- risk or living in suburban settings. Single property, single value \u00b6 The following examples show how to target interventions based on a single property value. At day 0 of the simulation, an outbreak starts. Target_Demographic is set to \u201cEveryone\u201d but Property_Restrictions restricts the start of the outbreak to the \u201cUrban\u201d group. { \"Events\" : [{ \"Event_Coordinator_Config\" : { \"Number_Distributions\" : -1 , \"Intervention_Config\" : { \"Antigen\" : 0 , \"Genome\" : 0 , \"Outbreak_Source\" : \"PrevalenceIncrease\" , \"class\" : \"OutbreakIndividual\" }, \"Demographic_Coverage\" : 1 , \"Target_Demographic\" : \"Everyone\" , \"Property_Restrictions\" : [ \"Place:Urban\" ], \"class\" : \"StandardInterventionDistributionEventCoordinator\" }, \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeSetAll\" }, \"Start_Day\" : 0 , \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" }] } Even if you have multiple properties defined in the demographics file, you can target interventions to a single property value in the same way. Individuals can be assigned any of the values for the other property types. In this example, values are defined for both the \u201cRisk\u201d and \u201cPlace\u201d property types. The outbreak only targets \u201cSuburban\u201d individuals using the \u201cPlace\u201d property type. Individuals can have any \u201cRisk\u201d value. { \"Events\" : [{ \"Event_Coordinator_Config\" : { \"Number_Distributions\" : -1 , \"Intervention_Config\" : { \"Antigen\" : 0 , \"Genome\" : 0 , \"Outbreak_Source\" : \"PrevalenceIncrease\" , \"class\" : \"OutbreakIndividual\" }, \"Demographic_Coverage\" : 1 , \"Target_Demographic\" : \"Everyone\" , \"Property_Restrictions\" : [ \"Place:Urban\" ], \"class\" : \"StandardInterventionDistributionEventCoordinator\" }, \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeSetAll\" }, \"Start_Day\" : 0 , \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" }] } Single property, multiple values \u00b6 If you want to target multiple values with the same property type, such as both \u201cUrban\u201d and \u201cRural\u201d values with the \u201cPlace\u201d property, you must use multiple interventions. You cannot have more than one group with the same property value in one intervention or outbreak. In this example, an outbreak starts at day 0 in the both the \u201cRural\u201d and \u201cUrban\u201d groups. { \"Events\" : [{ \"Event_Coordinator_Config\" : { \"Number_Distributions\" : -1 , \"Intervention_Config\" : { \"Antigen\" : 0 , \"Genome\" : 0 , \"Outbreak_Source\" : \"PrevalenceIncrease\" , \"class\" : \"OutbreakIndividual\" }, \"Demographic_Coverage\" : 1 , \"Target_Demographic\" : \"Everyone\" , \"Property_Restrictions\" : [ \"Place:Rural\" ], \"class\" : \"StandardInterventionDistributionEventCoordinator\" }, \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeSetAll\" }, \"Start_Day\" : 0 , \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" }, { \"Event_Coordinator_Config\" : { \"Number_Distributions\" : -1 , \"Intervention_Config\" : { \"Antigen\" : 0 , \"Genome\" : 0 , \"Outbreak_Source\" : \"PrevalenceIncrease\" , \"class\" : \"OutbreakIndividual\" }, \"Demographic_Coverage\" : 1 , \"Target_Demographic\" : \"Everyone\" , \"Property_Restrictions\" : [ \"Place:Urban\" ], \"class\" : \"StandardInterventionDistributionEventCoordinator\" }, \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeSetAll\" }, \"Start_Day\" : 0 , \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" }] } Multiple properties, individuals must match all values \u00b6 To target individuals how have values defined by different property types, such as people who are both urban and low risk, you can use a single intervention or outbreak. When two values from multiple properties are targeted in one intervention or outbreak, the event is only applied to individuals that are assigned both values. In this example, a vaccine intervention is targeted at low risk, suburban place individuals. Individuals who are targeted to receive the vaccine must have both property values. { \"Events\" : [{ \"Event_Coordinator_Config\" : { \"Demographic_Coverage\" : 1.0 , \"Intervention_Config\" : { \"Cost_To_Consumer\" : 10 , \"Durability_Time_Profile\" : \"BOXDECAYDURABILITY\" , \"Primary_Decay_Time_Constant\" : 3650 , \"Reduced_Acquire\" : 1 , \"Reduced_Transmit\" : 0 , \"Secondary_Decay_Time_Constant\" : 3650 , \"Vaccine_Take\" : 1 , \"Vaccine_Type\" : \"StrainSpecific\" , \"class\" : \"SimpleImmunoglobulin\" }, \"Target_Demographic\" : \"Everyone\" , \"Property_Restrictions\" : [ \"Risk:Low\" , \"Place:Suburban\" ], \"class\" : \"StandardInterventionDistributionEventCoordinator\" }, \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeSetAll\" }, \"Start_Day\" : 100 , \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" }] } Multiple properties, individuals must match at least one value \u00b6 However, if you want to target multiple properties, but individuals need to have only one of the specified values to qualify for the intervention, you must create a separate campaign event for each of the targeted property values. The events are applied separately and are applied to individuals that have one OR both property values; they need not have both. In this example, an outbreak is targeted at low risk individuals in the first intervention and suburban individuals in the second intervention. { \"Events\" : [{ \"Event_Coordinator_Config\" : { \"Number_Distributions\" : -1 , \"Intervention_Config\" : { \"Antigen\" : 0 , \"Genome\" : 0 , \"Outbreak_Source\" : \"PrevalenceIncrease\" , \"class\" : \"OutbreakIndividual\" }, \"Demographic_Coverage\" : 1 , \"Target_Demographic\" : \"Everyone\" , \"Property_Restrictions\" : [ \"Risk:Low\" ], \"class\" : \"StandardInterventionDistributionEventCoordinator\" }, \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeSetAll\" }, \"Start_Day\" : 0 , \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" }, { \"Event_Coordinator_Config\" : { \"Number_Distributions\" : -1 , \"Intervention_Config\" : { \"Antigen\" : 0 , \"Genome\" : 0 , \"Outbreak_Source\" : \"PrevalenceIncrease\" , \"class\" : \"OutbreakIndividual\" }, \"Demographic_Coverage\" : 1 , \"Target_Demographic\" : \"Everyone\" , \"Property_Restrictions\" : [ \"Place:Suburban\" ], \"class\" : \"StandardInterventionDistributionEventCoordinator\" }, \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeSetAll\" }, \"Start_Day\" : 0 , \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" }] } Alternatively, if you want to target multiple properties, one of which is the age bin, you could use Property_Restriction_Within_Node and the Age_Bin properties and Age_Bin_Property_From_X_To_Y values that are automatically created by EMOD when you use the Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years demographics parameter (see NodeProperties and IndividualProperties parameters). This allows you to use a single campaign event instead of multiple ones as you would with \u201cTarget_Demographic\u201d: \u201cExplicitAgeRanges\u201d . { \"Events\" : { \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" , \"Distributions\" : [{ \"Start_Day\" : 1 , \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeSetAll\" }, \"EventCoordinator_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"StandardInterventionDistributionEventCoordinator\" , \"Demographic_Coverage\" : 1 , \"Intervention_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeLevelHealthTriggeredIV\" , \"Property_Restrictions_Within_Node\" : [{ \"Risk\" : \"LOW\" , \"Age_Bin\" : \"Age_Bin_Property_From_0_To_5\" }, { \"Risk\" : \"MEDIUM\" , \"Age_Bin\" : \"Age_Bin_Property_From_5_To_13\" }, { \"Risk\" : \"HIGH\" , \"Age_Bin\" : \"Age_Bin_Property_From_13_To_125\" } ] } } }] } } Target an age range \u00b6 Targeting an intervention to an age range is set up differently than targeting an intervention to other property types. However, you can combine both kinds of restrictions. In this example, a vaccine campaign is targeted at urban individuals who are age 0 to 5. { \"Events\" : [{ \"Event_Coordinator_Config\" : { \"Demographic_Coverage\" : 1.0 , \"Intervention_Config\" : { \"Cost_To_Consumer\" : 10 , \"Durability_Time_Profile\" : \"BOXDECAYDURABILITY\" , \"Primary_Decay_Time_Constant\" : 3650 , \"Reduced_Acquire\" : 1 , \"Reduced_Transmit\" : 0 , \"Secondary_Decay_Time_Constant\" : 3650 , \"Vaccine_Take\" : 1 , \"Vaccine_Type\" : \"StrainSpecific\" , \"class\" : \"SimpleImmunoglobulin\" }, \"Target_Demographic\" : \"ExplicitAgeRanges\" , \"Target_Age_Min\" : 0 , \"Target_Age_Max\" : 5 , \"Property_Restrictions\" : [ \"Place:Urban\" ], \"class\" : \"StandardInterventionDistributionEventCoordinator\" }, \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeSetAll\" }, \"Start_Day\" : 30 , \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" }] }", "tags": "", "title": "Target interventions to nodes or groups \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./index.html", "text": "Welcome to IDM malaria modeling \u00b6 The Institute for Disease Modeling (IDM) develops complex software for disease modeling.

For some interventions, there can be a very complex hierarchical structure, including recursion. Typically, the file is named campaign.json. The relative path to this file is specified by Campaign_Filename in the configuration file. To distribute an intervention, you must configure the following: campaign event A JSON object that determines when and where an intervention is distributed during a campaign. event coordinator A JSON object that determines who will receive a particular intervention during a campaign. intervention A JSON object that determines what will be distributed to reduce the spread of a disease. An intervention can be distributed either to an individual (such as a vaccine, drug, or bednet) or to a node (such as a larvicide).

For example, the number of individuals, geographic data, climate, demographics, and migration data. This is in contrast to the demographic, geographic, and migration parameters in the configuration file that control simulation-wide qualities, such as enabling air migration across all nodes in the simulation. Although a demographics file is the only required input data file, additional files are generally needed for a realistic simulation. The demographics files use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) . The other input data files use both a JSON file for metadata and an associated binary file that contains the actual data. The Institute for Disease Modeling (IDM) provides collections of input data files for many different locations in the world for download on GitHub. Except for the demographics file, you will typically use these input data files in their default state. See Use input data files for more information. Demographics \u00b6 Demographics files are JSON formatted files containing information on the demographics of the population in a geographical region to simulate. For example, the number of individuals and the distribution for age, gender, immunity, risk, and mortality. In addition, demographics files are useful for creating heterogeneous groups within a population. You can define values for accessibility, age, geography, risk, and other properties and assign individuals to groups based on those property values. For example, you might want to divide a population up into different bins based on age so you can target interventions to individuals in a particular age range. Another common use is to configure treatment coverage to be higher for individuals in easily accessible regions and lower for individuals in areas that are difficult to access. EMOD assumes homogeneous mixing and disease transmission for the generic simulation type. You can use the HINT feature to add heterogeneous transmission to your generic model. You cannot manually configure heterogeneous transmission using HINT with other simulation types because the heterogeneity in transmission for specific diseases and disease classes is already configured by the simulation type. You can specify multiple demographics files, which function as a \u201cbase layer\u201d file and one or more \u201coverlay\u201d files that override the base layer configuration. Overlay files can change the value of parameters already specified in the base layer or add new parameters. Support for multiple demographics layers allows for the following scenarios: Separating different sets of parameters and values into individual layers (for example, to separate those that are useful for specific diseases into different layers) Adding new parameters for a simulation into a new layer for easier prototyping Overriding certain parameters of interest in a new layer Overriding certain parameters for a particular sub-region Simulating subsets of a larger region for which input data files have been constructed Migration \u00b6 Migration files describe the rate of migration of individuals in and out of a geographic node . There are four types of migration files that can be used by EMOD: local migration, regional migration, air migration, and sea migration. For all types, migration data is contained in a set of two files, a JSON metadata file with header information and a binary data file with the actual migration data. Both files are required. The basic file structure is identical for all types, with the only exception being the number of columns per row allowed to each type. Local \u00b6 Local migration describes the foot travel of people into and out of adjacent nodes. A local migration file is required for simulations that support more than one node. Regional \u00b6 Regional migration describes migration via a road or rail network. If a node is not part of the network, the regional migration of individuals to and from that node considers the closest road hub city. When you create the migration file, you must create a Voronoi tiling based on road hubs of the region, with each non-hub connected to the hub of its tile. Air \u00b6 Air migration describes migration via airplane travel. It is usually required for simulations of an entire country or larger geographies. Sea \u00b6 Sea migration describes migration via ship. Climate \u00b6 There are two general types of climate files usable by EMOD: climate files generated through actual data, referred to as \u201cclimate by data,\u201d and climate files generated from the Koppen classification system, referred to as \u201cclimate by Koppen.\u201d For both types, climate data is contained in a set of two files, a JSON metadata file with header information and a binary file that contains the actual climate data. Both files are required. Climate by data \u00b6 Climate by data files contain real data gathered from weather stations in the region to be simulated. This includes rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, and so on. Climate by Koppen \u00b6 Climate by Koppen files contain the Koppen classifier for the region. The Koppen classification system is one of the most widely used climate classification systems. It makes the assumption that native vegetation is the best reflection of climate. Load balancing \u00b6 When running a simulation on a multi-core HPC cluster, you can include a load balancing file to control how the computing load is distributed across the cluster. The load balancing file is a binary file that allocates the simulation of each geographic node to cores in the cluster. If no file is submitted, EMOD allocates nodes to cores according to a checkerboard pattern.", "tags": "", "title": "Input data files \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./intro-modeling.html", "text": "Introduction to disease modeling \u00b6 To understand the complex dynamics underlying disease transmission, epidemiologists utilize a set of models called compartmental models. Developed in the early 20th century, these models stratify a population into groups, generally based on their risk or infection status. Underlying these models is a system of differential equations, so the model is able to track the population as a function of time. Further, the models track the number of people in each category, are able to predict the various properties of pathogen spread, can estimate the duration of epidemics, and can be used to understand how different situations or interventions can impact the outcome of pathogen spread. To see a typical plot of a population in SIR conditions, see the plot in Types of compartmental models . If you would like a more in-depth introduction to epidemiology and disease modeling, you may want to take the Epidemics course from The Pennsylvania State University through Coursera. An agent-based model (ABM) is another powerful tool used to help understand the complexity inherent in disease transmission systems. These models form a type of \u201cmicroscale model,\u201d where they simulate the simultaneous interactions of agents in an effort to re-crate complex phenomena. Each agent (such as a human, or vector) can be assigned a variety of \u201cproperties\u201d (for example, age, gender, etc), and their behavior and interactions with one another are determined by using decision rules. These models have strong predictive power, and are able to leverage spatial and temporal dynamics. Further, complex environments can be developed in which the agents act, and agents may \u201clearn\u201d from interactions or \u201cadapt\u201d to their environment. As a result, ABMs are excellent for identifying \u201cemerging properties\u201d of the system: patterns that are not explicitly modeled, but instead occur as a consequence of the rules that govern the agents. Agent-based models are extensively used in epidemiology due to their predictive power in modeling the spread (or conversely, control) of epidemics. A popular type of ABM for this is one in which each agent\u2019s rules follow the dynamics specified in the compartmental models, where each agent flows through the compartments as a function of both \u201cwithin-host\u201d rules (such as duration of infection) and interactions between agents (such as becoming infected when coming into contact with an infectious agent). By combining the epidemiological basis of compartmental models with the flexibility of an agent-based model, this type of ABM is quite powerful due to their ability to simultaneously address the ecology, epidemiology, and pathology of complex systems. Why use disease modeling \u00b6 Disease models play an important role in understanding and managing the transmission dynamics of various pathogens. We can use them to describe the spatial and temporal patterns of disease prevalence, as well as to explore or better understand the factors that influence infection incidence. Modeling is a key step in understanding what treatments and interventions can be most effective, how cost-effective these approaches may be, and what specific factors need to be considered when trying to eradicate disease. Types of compartmental models \u00b6 The following diagrams illustrate common compartmental models. SIR Plot, showing typical categorization of a population into Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered states. Definitions \u00b6 Susceptible Individual is able to become infected. Exposed Individual has been infected with a pathogen, but due to the pathogen\u2019s incubation period, is not yet infectious. Infectious Individual is infected with a pathogen and is capable of transmitting the pathogen to others. Recovered Individual is either no longer infectious, or \u201cremoved\u201d from the population. SI (Susceptible - Infectious) model \u00b6 In this situation, people never leave the infectious state and have life-long infections. For example, herpes is a disease with life-long infectiousness. The dashed line shows how the model becomes an SIS (Susceptible - Infectious - Susceptible) model, where infection does not confer immunity (or there is waning immunity). Individuals have repeat or reoccurring infections, and infected individuals return to the susceptible state. For example, sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea or chlamydia fall into this group. SI - SIS model SIR (Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered) model \u00b6 In this category, individuals in the recovered state gain immunity to the pathogen. For example, measles, mumps, rubella, and pertussis may be modeled using the SIR framework. The dashed line shows how the model becomes an SIRS (Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered - Susceptible) model, where recovery does not confer life-long immunity, and individuals may become susceptible again. SIR - SIRS model SEIR (Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered) model \u00b6 In this category, individuals experience a long incubation duration (the \u201cexposed\u201d category), such that the individual is infected but not yet infectious . For example chicken pox, and even vector-borne diseases such as Dengue Hemorrhagic fever have a long incubation duration where the individual cannot yet transmit the pathogen to others. The dashed line shows how the model becomes an SEIRS (Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered - Susceptible) model, where recovered people may become susceptible again (recovery does not confer life-long immunity). For example, rotovirus and malaria are diseases with long incubation durations, and where infection only confers temporary immunity. SEIR - SEIRS model Fundamental concepts in epidemiology and disease modeling \u00b6 Basic reproductive number (R 0 ) The average number of secondary infections generated by the first infectious individual in a population of completely susceptible individuals. R 0 =S*L* (where S = the number of susceptible hosts, L = length of infection, and = transmissibility). When R 0 > 1, disease will spread. It is essentially a measure of the expected or average outcome of transmission. This is the threshold parameter used to determine whether or not an epidemic will occur, and determines: The initial rate of increase of an epidemic (the exponential growth phase). The final size of an epidemic (what fraction of susceptibles will be infected). The endemic equilibrium fraction of susceptibles in a population (=1/ R 0 ). The critical vaccination threshold, which is equal to 1-(1/ R 0 ), and determines the number of people that must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of a pathogen. Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) The number of years of life lost due to premature mortality plus the years lost due to disability while infected. Used to quantify the burden of disease. Epidemic An outbreak of an infectious disease, such that a greater number of individuals than normal has the disease. Epidemics have very high R 0 (Recall R 0 >1 for a disease to spread) and are often associated with acute, highly transmissible pathogens that can be directly transmitted. Further, pathogens with lower infectious periods create more explosive epidemics. To control epidemics, it is necessary to reduce R 0 . This can be done by: Reducing transmissibility. Decreasing the number of susceptibles (by vaccination, for example). Decreasing the mean number of contacts or the transmissibility, such as by improving sanitation, or limiting the number of interactions sick people have with healthy people. Reducing length of infectious period. Force of infection (FoI) A measure of the degree to which an infected individual can spread infection; the per-capita rate at which susceptibles contract infection. Typically increases with transmissibility and prevalence of infection. Herd immunity Vaccines protect individuals, but also provide indirect protection to anyone those vaccinated people may have infected. The portion of the population that needs to be immunized in order to achieve herd immunity is P > 1 \u2013 (1/ R 0 ), where P = proportion vaccinated * vaccine efficacy. Incidence (of a pathogen) The number of new cases or infections in a given time period. Immune Unable to become infected/infectious Prevalence (of a pathogen) The proportion of a population that is infectious at any given time. Transmissibility ( ) Also known as the effective contact rate, is the product of the contact rate and the probability of transmission per contact. Virulence The capacity of a pathogen to produce disease. It is proportional to parasitemia, or the number of circulating copies of the pathogen in the host. The higher the virulence (given contact between S and I individuals), the more likely transmission is to occur. However, higher virulence means contact may be less likely as infected hosts show more symptoms of the disease. There is a trade-off that occurs between high transmissibility and disease-induced mortality.", "tags": "", "title": "Introduction to disease modeling \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./intro-outputs.html", "text": "Output files \u00b6 After running a simulation, the simulation data is extracted, aggregated, and saved as an output report .

The EMOD functionality that produces an output report is known as a reporter . EMOD provides several built-in reporters for outputting data from simulations. By default, EMOD will always generate the report InsetChart.json, which contains the simulation-wide average disease prevalence by time step . If none of the provided reports generates the output report that you require, you can create a custom reporter.

The primary software, Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD), helps determine the combination of health policies and intervention strategies that can lead to disease eradication. EMOD calculates how diseases may spread in particular areas and is used to analyze the effects of current and future health policies and intervention strategies. It supports infectious disease campaign planning, data gathering, new product development, and policy decisions. We share this modeling software with the research community to advance the understanding of disease dynamics. EMOD supports the following simulation types for modeling a variety of diseases: Generic disease (GENERIC_SIM) Vector-borne diseases (VECTOR_SIM) Malaria (MALARIA_SIM) Tuberculosis (TB_SIM) Sexually transmitted infections (STI_SIM) HIV (HIV_SIM) The illustration below shows how the simulation types are built upon one another. All parameters available in the generic simulation type are inherited by the vector simulation type. The vector simulation type adds additional parameters specific to the biology of vector-borne diseases, which in turn are inherited by the malaria simulation type and so on. Therefore, depending on the simulation type you select, different parameters are available for you to use. In addition, simulation types for broader classes of disease can be extended to build your own disease-specific model. Simulation type inheritance EMOD is a stochastic , agent-based model that simulates the actions and interactions of individuals within geographic areas known as nodes to understand the disease dynamics in a population over time. EMOD can produce statistically significant results over a broad set of parameters and scenarios. Quantitative analysis of the simulated output enables disease eradication efforts to make more data-driven decisions. The IDM research team has published many articles related to modeling, as well as the modeling concepts underpinning EMOD. For a list of published articles, see IDM Publications . This section provides the conceptual overview of EMOD. The architecture diagram below shows, at a high level, how the system functions. If you run simulations in parallel on a multi-node cluster, there is also a Message Passing Interface (MPI) component used to pass data between multiple instances of EMOD. High-level EMOD system architecture Input data files \u00b6 Not all files accepted as input for running a simulation are considered input data files. Rather, input data files contain the relatively fixed information about a population to model. For example, climate, geography, demographics, and migration data. Configuration file \u00b6 The configuration file contains parameters that control many different aspects of the simulation. EMOD provides hundreds of parameters for you to configure your simulation. For example, configuration parameters can control the following: The disease or disease class to simulate (simulation type) The name and location for the input data files and output files Whether to include births, deaths, and migration Disease attributes, such as infectivity, transmission, immunity, and mortality The computing resources to use Campaign file \u00b6 The campaign file contains parameters that distribute outbreaks and the interventions used to control the spread of disease. For example, campaign parameters can control the following: Target demographic (age, location, gender, etc.) for interventions Diagnostic tests to use The cost and timing of interventions Running a simulation \u00b6 The EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) accepts the input data, configuration, and campaign files and then simulates the susceptibility and infection of individuals within each geographic node . The simulation type controls the transmission mechanism of the disease. After the simulation is complete, the Eradication.exe produces output reports that describe various aspects of the disease dynamics within the modeled population. You can run simulations locally or on a multi-core cluster. Because the model is stochastic , you must run simulations multiple times to produce scientifically valid results. Depending on how you run the simulation, other programs or environments external to EMOD may also output error and logging files. Output files \u00b6 After the simulation finishes, a reporter extracts simulation data, aggregates it, and outputs it to a file (known as an output report ). Most of the reports are also JSON files, the most important of which is InsetChart.json. The InsetChart.json file provides simulation-wide averages of disease prevalence at each time step .

You have a few different options for running simulations. The option you choose will depend upon whether you want to run one or more simulations, to run simulations locally or on a remote cluster (for large simulations or multiple simulations), or to run simulations for debugging the source code. This topic briefly describes the different options you have for running simulations. Run a single simulation \u00b6 You will generally want to run simulations using the EMOD command-line options. This will run a single simulation and put the output files in a local directory. You must either download the latest version of Eradication.exe from GitHub or clone the EMOD source from GitHub and build Eradication.exe yourself. This gives you access to the latest features and parameters for EMOD. Run multiple simulations \u00b6 Because the EMOD model is stochastic , simulations must be run multiple times to return scientifically valid results. Therefore, you have the following options to run multiple simulations at a time, either locally or remotely on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. Generally, only small simulations should be run locally. Many of these options are scripting languages that you can also use to modify the files consumed by EMOD, simplifying your workflow when running many simulations. Run simulations for debugging \u00b6 If you are helping advance the EMOD model by contributing to source code, there are other options for running simulations that provide debugging support. These options for running simulations are not recommended if you are not modifying the source code. You can run a simulation locally from Visual Studio using the built-in debugger. You will be able to put in breakpoints and step through the code while inspecting the values of different state variables throughout the simulation.

Modeling mass antimalarial campaigns can elucidate how to most effectively deploy drug-based interventions and quantitatively compare the effects of cure, prophylaxis, and transmission-blocking in suppressing parasite prevalence. Individuals in a simulation can receive antimalarial drugs as treatment for clinical or severe malaria or during a mass drug administration (MDA) campaign. The following information explains how to configure antimalarial drug parameters in a configuration file. For a complete list of configuration parameters that are used in the malaria model, see the Configuration parameters . To specify where, when, and to whom the antimalarial drugs are administered, you must create an AntiMalarialDrug intervention in the campaign file. See Campaign parameters for more information. Modeling a box profile of antimalaria drug pharmacokinetics \u00b6 Pharmacokinetics (PK) of antimalarial drugs can be modeled with a box profile or with a double exponential decay. Pharmacodynamics (PD) of antimalarial drugs are modeled as an on/off switch for box PK or with a simple sigmoid for double exponential PK. If multiple drugs are given in a treatment, each drug is considered independently for both PK and PD. To model a box PK, set the parameter PKPD_Model to FIXED_DURATION_CONSTANT_EFFECT. Drugs will have full killing efficacy for the duration set by Drug_Decay_T1 . Dosing multiple times leads to multiple pulses of drug killing if dose separation is longer than Drug_Decay_T1 . If dose separation ( Drug_Dose_Interval ) is shorter than Drug_Decay_T1 , the box time is reset by each new dose such that drug killing is switched off after time Drug_Decay_T1 after the last dose. Modeling drug killing effects with a box profile. (A) A single dose of drug kills parasites at maximum efficacy for duration set by Drug_Decay_T1 . (B) A drug given in multiple doses results in multiple parasite killing pulses of duration Drug_Decay_T1 if the dose separation Drug_Dose_Interval is longer than Drug_Decay_T1 . (C) If a drug\u2019s dosing regimen results in doses taken before time Drug_Decay_T1 has elapsed, the drug kills parasites at maximum efficacy the entire time between the first dose and time Drug_Decay_T1 after the last dose. The following example provides the syntax: { \"Malaria_Drug_Params\" : { \"Artemether_Lumefantrine\" : { \"Drug_Cmax\" : 1000 , \"Drug_Decay_T1\" : 1 , \"Drug_Decay_T2\" : 1 , \"Drug_Dose_Interval\" : 1 , \"Drug_Fulltreatment_Doses\" : 3 , \"Drug_Gametocyte02_Killrate\" : 2.3 , \"Drug_Gametocyte34_Killrate\" : 2.3 , \"Drug_GametocyteM_Killrate\" : 0 , \"Drug_Hepatocyte_Killrate\" : 0 , \"Drug_PKPD_C50\" : 100 , \"Drug_Vd\" : 10 , \"Max_Drug_IRBC_Kill\" : 4.61 , \"Bodyweight_Exponent\" : 0 }, \"Artemisinin\" : {}, \"Chloroquine\" : {}, \"GenPreerythrocytic\" : {}, \"GenTransBlocking\" : {}, \"Primaquine\" : {}, \"Quinine\" : {}, \"SP\" : {}, \"Tafenoquine\" : {} } } Modeling a double exponential PK \u00b6 To model a double exponential PK, set the parameter PKPD_Model to CONCENTRATION_VERSUS_TIME. The double exponential PK approximates a one- or two-compartment PK model. To model a drug with 1-compartment PK, set Drug_Decay_T2 equal to Drug_Decay_T1 ( Drug_Vd becomes irrelevant). For PD, the Drug_PKPD_C50 determines the drug concentrations where parasite killing is effective (drug concentration > C50) and ineffective (drug concentration < C50). EMOD sets the shape of the parasite killing curve based on parasite kill rate and C50. Drug_Cmax , Drug_Decay_T1 , Drug_Decay_T2 , Drug_Vd , and Drug_PKPD_C50 together determine when the drug is effectively killing parasites. Changing each of these parameters will affect how long the parasites are exposed to a strong killing effect. Adding additional doses will also increase the duration of the parasite- killing window. Children can be dosed with a fraction of the adult dose according to Fractional_Dose_By_Upper_Age , where each dose fraction is paired with the maximum age of children receiving that dose. Depending on specific PK characteristics of each drug, bodyweight may affect the rate of drug clearance. In the double exponential PK model, bodyweight is directly determined by age, and Drug_Cmax is multiplied by the inverse of the bodyweight raised to the power of Bodyweight_Exponent . See the paper on drug PK and PD ( Mass campaigns with antimalarial drugs: a modelling comparison of artemether-lumefantrine and DHA-piperaquine with and without primaquine as tools for malaria control and elimination ) for more details on how to set PK and PD parameter values in EMOD.

Climate, which includes rainfall, temperature, and humidity, directly influences availability of larval habitat, determines mosquito developmental and survival rates, and impacts human behavior that leads to contact with infectious mosquitoes. This framework explores the impact of different locations and weather patterns in single node and multi-node geographies. It explores demographics data for births, deaths, age initialization and immunity. Climate and demographics spatial data is configured for a geographic location, such as a rainfall-driven larval habitat, to create a climate-based distribution model of malaria transmission. The seasonality of species abundances are considered, as are rainfall, temperature, humidity and larval dynamics. Mosquito species and seasonality are depicted by habitat preferences that are, for example, temporary, semi-permanent or permanent. Clearly, climate and habitat type are inextricably linked. However, it is possible to have several types of habitat within a given climate region; for this reason, climate is configured separately from habitat type. You may choose from a variety of options to configure climate, ranging from pre-set classification systems to uploaded user data. Further, it is possible to enable stochasticity in climate as well as in rainfall patterns. For example, rainfall data may be based off of monthly totals averaged per day. In the simulation configuration file, the parameter Enable_Rainfall_Stochasticity will set up daily rainfalls drawn from an exponential distribution with the same daily mean. This preserves approximate monthly totals, but produces a more realistic rainfall pattern for the simulation. For more information on how to configure climate, see Climate file structure .

In the microsolver, the development of clinical and parasitological immunity is tracked through innate and adaptive immune responses to specific antigens. A detailed parasite count over time is tracked for each infected individual. This permits the simulation of measured prevalence over time by slide microscopy, RDTs (Rapid Diagnostic Tests) or other diagnostics. Gametocyte production and decay is included to study the human infectious reservoir. Immune variables, such as antibody levels for each antigen, inflammatory cytokine levels, and immunological memory are represented by continuous floating-point variables. Most model parameters have a specific physical interpretation and can be rationally constrained by defined experimental measurements. For a complete list of configuration parameters that are used in the malaria model, see the Configuration parameters . Within-host parasite dynamics \u00b6 Within the microsolver framework, each new infection begins with a hepatic (liver-stage) latency of fixed duration (7 days) and proceeds through cycles of asexual replication (with a fixed duration of 2 days) and gametocyte production (which takes 10 days). The model accounts for several antigenic components to which the immune system may develop immunity: the merozoite surface protein (MSP) variant, the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) presented on the surface of the infected red-blood cell (IRBC), and less immunogenic minor surface epitopes (nonspecific epitopes). Within-host dynamics Gametocyte development \u00b6 The model advances gametocytes through five stages of development that are characterized by different drug susceptibilities. A fraction of gametocytes die at each developmental stage, and gametocytes can be inactivated by cytokines after uptake in a blood meal. Gametocytes reach maturity after ten days and remain in the bloodstream with a 2.5-day half-life. EMOD does not model acquired immunity to gametocytes. Gametocyte development Modeling a single clonal infection \u00b6 A single clonal infection is modeled with an antigenic repertoire of 50 unique PfEMP-1 variants where each is associated with one of five repeating minor epitopes. In the first asexual cycle, the first five variants are expressed in equal numbers. At each update, the immune system is stimulated by the Infected Red Blood Cell (IRBC) count of each antigenic variant, and concurrently, the IRBC counts are decremented on account of immune and drug killing effects. At the end of each asexual cycle, the model calculates the fraction of merozoites (16 for each previous IRBC) killed by specific recognition of the MSP variant, and the fraction that is differentiated into male and female gametocytes. To capture the dynamics of the parasite\u2019s immune evasion strategy, the model imposes a constant per-parasite switching rate on the remaining merozoites to advance to subsequent antigenic variants in the repertoire. Parasite strain switching Population-level variants \u00b6 The number of population-level variants affect the age-pattern of natural immunity acquisition. The full set of population-level antigenic variants (out of which a single infection\u2019s repertoire is randomly drawn), consists of 100 MSP variants, 20 sets of five minor epitopes, and 1000 PfEMP-1 variants. Some parameters drive the asymptotic levels of adult detected parasitemia while others primarily govern the transition between child and adult detected prevalence rates, and provide that the number of PfEMP-1 variants is substantially more than an individual would experience in a year. A multi-year burn-in period ensures immune initialization dynamics approximate long-term asymptotic behavior where individuals in the simulation build antibody responses to a broad repertoire of parasite antigens appropriate for their age. Immune response to infection \u00b6 The immune response to infection is characterized by innate inflammatory and specific antibody components that limit maximum parasite density and work to clear infection. As the antibody response increases on a dimensionless scale from 0 to 1, the initial inflammatory response is suppressed. After the antibody response appears, continued antigenic stimulation will drive up the adapted response until that antigenic variant is cleared, at which point both the antibody levels and the capacity to respond will decay over time. The larger the antigenic population, the more infections, and thus time, it takes to acquire broad parasitological immunity. Innate and adaptive immunity work together to limit asexual parasite numbers Innate immune response \u00b6 The innate immune response is modeled to depend on a temporary contribution from a rupturing schizont at the end of each asexual cycle, as well as the concentration of IRBC surface antigens to which an antibody response has not yet been developed. The innate response that is suppressed by the presence of specific antibodies is responsible for driving febrile symptoms and broad-spectrum parasite suppression. Innate immune response Adaptive immune response \u00b6 The capacity to generate specific antibodies grows in response to the concentration of each novel antigen. Above a capacity threshold level, antibodies are produced in increasing concentration until the corresponding antigenic variant is cleared. At this time, the capacity will decay to a non-zero memory level. The mechanism by which the antibody capacity evolves captures the time delay of specific antibody response on re-infection.

Rainfall and humidity can strongly affect available larval habitat, although this depends on the mosquito species and its particular habitat preference. For example, Anopheles funestus , which prefers more semi-permanent larval habitat, exhibits rainfall dependence, partly due to vegetation on edges of water and the interaction of rainfall with agricultural schedules for crops such as rice. Further, preference can vary within species: An. funestus exhibits differences in population responses to rainfall which are correlated with chromosomal diversity. In addition to available habitat, mosquito populations depend on larval development and mortality rates. These in turn are affected by a variety of factors, including climate, short term weather, and densities of other larvae. In the present model, different models for larval habitat are developed for temporary, semi- permanent, permanent, and human-driven habitats. The duration of larval development is a decreasing function of temperature, and the present model utilizes an Arrhenius temperature-dependent rate a 1 (a2/TK) . In some cases, this temperature-dependent rate must be modified by local larval density. Rainfall and temperature then combine through habitat creation and larval development to create varying local patterns of distribution by larval instar, and larval mortality and development duration determine pupal rates. The creation of the habitat model is described in further detail in the articles Eckhoff, Malaria Journal 2011, 10:303 , Eckhoff, Malaria Journal 2012, 11:419 , and Eckhoff, Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2013, 88(5) . The following sections provide information regarding specific larval habitat types and how to configure these parameters in EMOD. For a complete list of configuration parameters that are used in the malaria model, see the Configuration parameters . Modeling mosquito life cycles and larval habitat \u00b6 The framework facilitates simulating multiple species of Anopheles mosquitoes simultaneously. This allows for a mechanistic description of vector abundances through the effects of climate and weather on different preferred larval habitats. Each species is configured separately according to its ecological and behavioral preferences. For example, the female An. arabiensis deposits eggs primarily in temporary, rainfall-driven habitat and has a higher propensity to feed outdoors or on livestock. In contrast, An. farauti larvae live in brackish lagoons in the Solomon Islands, where lagoons fill with rain, and larvae are washed out into the ocean due to excess rain. The temporary rainfall relationship between larval habitat and rainfall cannot reproduce abrupt (sub-week) changes in biting rates, and an additional rainfall-driven larval mortality term has been implemented to capture the non-linear rain-to-habitat relationship. Vector abundance depends on larval habitat availability Larval habitat type determines how rainfall and temperature influence vector populations Larval habitat types \u00b6 The parameter Larval_Habitat_Types is a dictionary that contains one or more string and integer pairs. The user indicates the vector species, habitat type(s), and the array of scaling factors used to determine the volume of that habitat needed for larvae to develop. Note that multiple species may utilize the same habitat, with each species existing independently. The scaling factor represents the number of larvae in a 1x1-degree area. The factor multiplicatively scales the resulting weather or population dependent functional form. The following example shows how to use this parameter, using Anopheles funestus as the vector and CONSTANT as the scaled habitat type. { \"Vector_Species_params\" : { \"funestus\" : { \"Larval_Habitat_Types\" : { \"CONSTANT\" : 10000000 }, \"Acquire_Modifier\" : 0.2 } } } The following are possible values for Larval_Habitat_Types . They are described in detail below. TEMPORARY_RAINFALL WATER_VEGETATION CONSTANT BRACKISH_SWAMP HUMAN_POPULATION LINEAR_SPLINE Temporary rainfall \u00b6 TEMPORARY_RAINFALL habitat corresponds to mosquitoes such as Anopheles arabiensis or Anopheles gambiae which breed primarily in temporary puddles which are replenished by rainfall and drain through evaporation and infiltration. We have developed a series of update equations for the larval carrying capacity which scale the functional form for evaporation rates. This creates a relationship in which evaporation and infiltration are higher when the weather is hot and dry. The basic update equations appear in the article Eckhoff, Malaria Journal 2011, 10:303 and are as follows: Temporary habitat H temp in a grid of diameter D cell increases with rainfall P rain and decays with a rate temp proportional to the evaporation rate driven by temperature T(K) and humidity RH: in which the exponential results from the Clausius-Clayperon relation , the root is from the expression for vapor evaporation rates due to molecular mass given a partial pressure, and the constant is the Clausius-Clayperon integration constant multiplied by a factor k tempdecay to relate mass evaporation per unity area to habitat loss. Examining the two equations more closely, the first is a time step update equation, in which available habitat is increased by a multiple of the rainfall in the past time step, scaled by the size of the node in the simulation. For example, a 5 km square node will have 25 times the habitat of a 1 km square node. Then existing habitat decays with a time constant defined by the second equation. The basic functional form is based on an equation for evaporation rates, which is not fully realistic in that it neglects boundary layer effects. However, we are looking for a rate of habitat loss, not the rate of evaporation, and we also want to take infiltration into account. The parameter k tempdecay converts raw evaporation rates in kg/m^2/s into habitat loss per day. The value of k tempdecay is initially chosen to set the habitat half-lives near 1 day for hot and dry conditions and 2-3 weeks for more tropical conditions. The parameter k tempdecay in the article Eckhoff, Malaria Journal 2011, 10:303 corresponds to Temporary_Habitat_Decay_Factor in the simulation configuration file, and it applies to all local species using temporary habitat. Each species in a given location can adjust the parameter k temp from the paper, or equivalently the scaling factor value in Larval_Habitat_Types in the simulation configuration file (nested under the species name), to adjust the overall scaling of the time series. So k temp is specific for each species, but k tempdecay is a single value for all temporary habitat species in that location. Basically, the local weather and k tempdecay set the overall time profile for larval habitat which can feed-forward into adult population levels and biting rates. k tempdecay can be adjusted to achieve a best fit for the time profile for a given location. Factors such as how sandy or clay-like the soil is will affect this value. Once the time profile is correct, k temp can be adjusted to yield the correct annual entomological inoculation rate (EIR) for that species. Semi-permanent water vegetation \u00b6 The second type of larval habitat, WATER_VEGETATION, is a semi-permanent habitat, which corresponds to developing vegetation on the edges of semi-permanent habitat. This could be seen for swamp-like or rice cultivation settings, in which the development of vegetation lags the rainfall and will be closest to its peak towards the end of the rainy season. The decay is specified as a loss of habitat per day, and this slower decay constant means that species with this habitat type will tend to have a proportionately higher dry-season population relative to the temporary habitat species. In the model, semi-permanent habitat increases with a constant K semi D cell 2P rain and decays with a longer time constant semi ( Semipermanent_Habitat_Decay_Rate in the simulation configuration file). The parameter K semi is the scale factor value in Larval_Habitat_Types for species with a Larval_Habitat_Types of \u201cWATER_VEGETATION\u201d. Permanent habitat is fixed at K perm D cell 2, and human population-driven habitat is calculated as population N* K pop . The values of k tempdecay , semi , K semi , and K temp can be fit to local data on vector abundance by species over time or to local data on EIR to tailor a simulation to a specific setting. Constant habitat \u00b6 For habitat type CONSTANT, larval carrying capacity is constant throughout the year and does not depend on weather. However, there will be a seasonal signal in adult population levels due to the effects of temperature upon aquatic development times. For a given carrying capacity, a faster development time will allow a local habitat to have a higher larval \u201cthrough-put\u201d with corresponding impacts on the adult population. The scaling factor value in the Larval_Habitat_Types parameter is used to specify the carrying capacity per unit area D cell 2. Brackish swamp \u00b6 The BRACKISH_SWAMP habitat setting deals with the dynamics of how rain fills a brackish swamp, how it decays and the associated parameter for rainfall-driven mortality threshold. This habitat type is observable in the Solomon Islands where an entire larval generation is flushed away as a result of the overflowing lagoon geography. Since this is the case, the TEMPORARY_RAINFALL relationship between larval habitat and rainfall cannot reproduce these abrupt changes (on 0 week timescales) of biting rates. So, an additional rainfall-driven larval mortality term has been implemented that captures the non-linear rain-to- habitat relationship. This habitat uses the same decay rate as the semi-permanent water vegetation habitat. Rainfall-driven mortality during swamp flushing Human population \u00b6 The habitat type HUMAN_POPULATION scales with correlates of urban development, for example, water that is available due to water pots in urban areas. This type is configured by multiplying the number of people in the node\u2019s population times the capacity value set in Larval_Habitat_Types . Further, climate is not involved in setting the capacity, as available water is not dependent on rainfall (it is instead dependent on human-provided water sources). Linear spline \u00b6 LINEAR_SPLINE is a recent addition to the types of habitat supported. Instead of specifying a habitat type, users may utilize data that tracks the number of larvae measured throughout the year to estimate the daily larval population using linear interpolation. In other words, this option enables the user to use data collected from a specific site, or create data files to match a particular location. This option does not replace the climatological parameters, but it instead adds a more flexible option in which you do not need climate data. LINEAR_SPLINE has different syntax than the other habitat types, as the user is now required to provide a distribution of the larval population. The following example provides the syntax for configuring this habitat type: { \"Vector_Species_params\" : { \"funestus\" : { \"Larval_Habitat_Types\" : { \"LINEAR_SPLINE\" : { \"Capacity_Distribution_Per_Year\" : { \"Times\" : [ 0.0 , 60.833 , 121.667 , 182.5 , 243.333 , 304.167 ], \"Values\" : [ 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.2 , 1.0 , 0.5 , 0.0 ] }, \"Max_Larval_Capacity\" : 10000000000.0 } } } } } Modifying habitat availability \u00b6 Ultimately, habitat is configured in order to create mosquito populations that realistically emulate observed entomological inoculation rate (EIR) . Briefly, available habitat is directly related to mosquito abundance, and mosquito abundance in turn is directly related to biting rate. In order to calibrate the model there are several options for configuring habitat. You can first set habitat parameters and modify them directly using the habitat scalar and decay rate. Then, after those initial parameters are set, you can modify habitat with overall scaling parameters. Habitat scalars and decay rates \u00b6 The following two figures demonstrate the effects of varying the habitat scalar ( Larval_Habitat_Types ) and the Temporary_Habitat_Decay_Factor (k tempdecay ) for a single species with temporary habitat. Changing the habitat scalar will scale the resulting adult population size and biting rate by a similar factor. Effect of varying the habitat scalar, Larval_Habitat_Types Lowering k tempdecay causes the resulting rainfall-driven habitat to decay at a slower rate and thus increases temp . A slower decay rate will result in higher larval habitat on average, and higher resulting adult population biting rates. Effect of varying the decay rate, Temporary_Habitat_Decay_Factor (k tempdecay ) These two parameters can be co-varied to produce an appropriate temporal profile. If rainfall is constant, there is only one degree of freedom, as the habitat is always at equilibrium. The two degrees of freedom become important when there is a distinct rainy season. For example, scaling habitat produces the same ratio between biting rates in the wet season and dry season as seen in Effect of Varying Habitat Scalar. However, when varying the decay rate, the ratio between habitats is different in the wet season versus the dry season. As seen in the graph \u201cEffect of Varying Temporary Habitat Decay Scalar\u201d, a given ratio in rainy season will become exaggerated in the start of dry season (with a higher ratio the drier the season), as the slower decay rate extends habitat longer into the dry season. Overall scaling \u00b6 Often, it is desired to study a similar location, with the same species, temporal profile, etc., but with a different annual entomological inoculation rate (EIR) . EIR depends not only on climate, but on larval habitat availability as well. So as an alternative for modifying all climate and habitat parameters to change EIR, it is simpler to use the habitat scaling parameter, x_Temporary_Larval_Habitat found in the configuration file. This parameter will scale all habitat parameters without changing the temporal dynamics, so that a new transmission is achieved with the same ratios among the species, and same time profile. For example, setting x_Temporary_Larval_Habitat to 0.1 would simulate low EIR (or a low transmission setting) by reducing available habitat to 10%; a value of 1 could be used to simulate high EIR (or a high transmission setting), and there would be no reduction in available habitat. An alternative to x_Temporary_Larval_Habitat is LarvalHabitatMulitpilier . LarvalHabitatMultiplier is a parameter in the demographics file, and can be applied to all habitat types configured for the simulation, specific habitat types, or individual mosquito species within particular habitat types in the Nodes array of the demographics file (see NodeAttributes in Demographics parameters ). The following example shows the syntax: { \"Nodes\" : { \"NodeID\" : 340461476 , \"NodeAttributes\" : { \"LarvalHabitatMultiplier\" : 10.0 } } } It should be noted that LarvalHabitatMultiplier enables habitat availability to be modified independently for each species within a shared habitat. This is an upgrade over previous versions of EMOD in which the modifier would be applied equally to all species within a shared habitat.", "tags": "", "title": "Larval habitat \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./malaria-model-framework.html", "text": "Malaria model structure and framework \u00b6 The malaria EMOD is complex, with numerous configurable parameters.

As there are numerous parameters in the model, it is useful to categorize parameters into components, which are described in the Malaria model structure and framework section. The core of the simulation consists of solvers for mosquito population dynamics, pathogen transmission to and from the human host population, and dynamics of the infection within the human host. While the human population is fully individual-based, the mosquito population can be represented by discrete cohorts or individual agent mosquitoes. As an agent-based model, interactions between humans and vectors advance during each time step. The mosquito population is advanced, for example, through discrete 1-day time steps during which mosquitoes may engage in host- seeking or feeding behaviors, mating, maturation through a life-stage, or even death. Successful feeds on humans can result in infection of the human host, or conversely, susceptible mosquitoes may become infected from an infectious human. Model implementation structure \u00b6 There are two categories of possible implementations of the basic model, each with different computational efficiencies, resolutions, and flexibilities. The first is an individual model, where it simulates every individual mosquito in the population or can utilize a sampled subset of mosquitoes to represent the population as the whole. The second is a modified cohort simulation, with or without explicit mosquito ages. Individual mosquito model \u00b6 This basic model can be implemented through simulation of every individual mosquito, or by simulation of a subset of individual mosquitoes to represent the full population. Each mosquito\u2019s state contains status (susceptible, latently infected, and infectious), timers for transition to adult from immature and infected to infectious, mating status and Wolbachia infection, and age. An oviposition timer to enforce a fixed feeding cycle may be included as well. If mosquitoes are sampled and a subset used to represent the local population, each sampled mosquito will have an associated sampling weight as well. Cohort model \u00b6 In the modified cohort simulation, rather than representing the entire population by three compartments for susceptible, latently infected, and infectious mosquitoes, the simulation dynamically allocates a cohort for every distinct state, and the cohort maintains the count of all mosquitoes in that state. This allows temperature-dependent progression through sporogony , even with a different mean temperature each day, with no mosquitoes passing from susceptible to infectious before the full discrete latency. For the cohort simulation with explicit ages, in order to allow modeling of senescence, mosquito age is part of the state definition, and many more cohorts are required to represent the population. Discrete and continuous processes \u00b6 The model implements a hybrid of discrete and continuous processes that work together to capture system latencies and discrete events inherent in the population dynamics of humans, mosquitoes, and parasites. Discrete events, such as latencies in the infected hepatocyte stage, the length of the asexual cycle from merozoite invasion to schizont rupture, and gametocyte maturation have particular time durations. State changes occur after the completion of the required amount of time (with specific time durations set for each state). See the figure of the Plasmodium life-cycle in Malaria disease overview for more information regarding the life-cycle stages used in this example. Other processes, such as the decay of antibodies and the clearance of parasites, are represented by continuous-time processes. These are solved with a one-hour time step Euler method . All parasite quantities, such as the number of hepatocytes, number of merozoites, number of infected red blood cells of each antigenic variant, and gametocytes of each stage are represented as discrete integers. The infection is not cleared until each category is reduced to zero. This allows resolution of model dynamics at subpatent levels. Spatial-scale dynamics and migration \u00b6 Extensive multi- node simulations with location-specific climate, intervention deployments, larval habitat, and migration may be configured within the EMOD framework. Nodes can be configured to best represent the spatial scale being simulated: a node can be the household level, village level, county level, country level, or other desired geographic scale. Migration can be enabled between nodes, such that EMOD can most accurately represent the dynamics of the location. By varying spatial-scale resolution, relevant factors for transmission dynamics can be more clearly elucidated. The following visualization shows an example of a gridded representation of malaria transmission on the island of Madagascar.

The model utilizes microsolvers to combine detailed vector population dynamics, human population dynamics, human immunity, within-host parasite dynamics, effects of antimalarial drugs, and other aspects of malaria biology to simulate malaria transmission. EMOD can be calibrated to particular geographic locations, and the microsolver framework enables the model\u2019s functionality to be highly modifiable. Further, the framework includes the ability to add intervention campaigns, and those interventions can be specified to target particular populations or sub-populations of human or vector groups. Interventions can be deployed within simulations for a variety of transmission settings with different transmission intensities, vector behaviors, and seasonally-driven ecologies. The following pages describe the structure of the model, and then explore each of the model components. Additionally, the specifics of the model are discussed in detail in the articles Eckhoff, Malaria Journal 2011, 10:303 ; Eckhoff, Malaria Journal 2012, 11:419 ; Eckhoff, PLoS ONE 2012, 7(9) ; and Eckhoff, Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2013, 88(5) . The generic software architecture of EMOD can be found on Introduction to the software . The malaria EMOD is based on the same architecture, with modifications that transform the generic model into a vector-based model. For example, transmission occurs via vectors (and the associated climatalogical impacts on vector biology), individuals can have multiple infections, and campaign interventions can act at the individual level or at the node level. Typical SEIR models are described in Introduction to disease modeling . Vectors add a level of complexity to the interactions, as pathogens are transmitted via vector - human - vector. For malaria, the SEIR model would appear as follows: While EMOD is an agent-based model, both the simulated humans and vectors move through the various infection states analogously to the compartmental model illustrated above. To account for the real-world complexity of malaria transmission, numerous parameters have been added to EMOD to increase its predictive power. Further, these parameters and their associated microsolvers allow EMOD to model aspects of malaria infections and population dynamics that do not readily fit into the SEIRS framework (for example, within-host parasite dynamics, parasitalogical immunity, and innate and adaptive responses to antigens). Finally, as an agent- based model, EMOD enables the addition of spatial and temporal properties to the simulation. The following pages describe this complexity in detail.

For the individual mosquito model, the values are \u201cTRACK_ALL_VECTORS\u201d or \u201cSAMPLE_IND_VECTORS\u201d. Basic species configuration \u00b6 The simulation configuration file has a field Vector_Species_Names which specifies the vector species that will be present in the simulation. For example, the following specifies that Anopheles arabiensis , An. funestus , and An. gambiae will be added to the simulation: { \"Vector_Species_Names\" : [ \"arabiensis\" , \"funestus\" , \"gambiae\" ] } For each species listed, a \u201cVectorPopulation\u201d object will be added to the simulation at each node. Each species will be defined by parameters in the simulation configuration file for the vector ecology and behavior of the species. This allows for a mechanistic description of vector abundances and behavior through the effects of climate and weather on different preferred larval habitats. The following example shows the syntax for configuring species parameters for Anopheles arabiensis .

We are committed to supporting data-driven malaria control and elimination efforts. This page will provide information about the disease itself. The following pages will provide information about the the vector class of Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD), the software developed by IDM to aid in malaria elimination. Malaria biology \u00b6 Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by plasmodium parasites transmitted through the bite of blood-feeding Anopheles mosquitos. There are roughly 30 species of Anophelenes capable of serving as malaria vectors, and only females bite (i.e. seek blood meals) to gain nutrients necessary for oviposition . After taking blood meals, females lay eggs in water sources, where the emerging larvae hatch and mature. Each species of Anopheles has different aquatic habitat preferences, ranging from small, ephemeral pools to large swampy areas, and in some cases, brackish water. Transmission of malaria depends on both biotic and abiotic factors. Mosquito lifespan is positively correlated to transmission intensity. Mosquito populations, and therefore transmission, tend to be seasonal with dependence on climatic conditions such as rainfall patterns, humidity, and temperature. Typically, malaria transmission peaks during and after the rainy season, when conditions are prime for mosquito reproduction. Additionally, transmission is dependent on human immunity: people living in areas of high exposure to malaria can develop partial immunity, which reduces the risk of developing severe disease. Unfortunately, such partial immunity may mask symptoms of disease (and obscure infection), which may hinder control or elimination efforts. Once an infected mosquito bites a human and transmits parasites, the parasites multiply in the host\u2019s liver, then infect and destroy red blood cells (erythrocytes). During the blood stage, the parasites that infect and destroy erythrocytes release merozoites which then infect other erythrocytes. The gametocyte form of the blood-stage parasite are ingested by female Anophelenes during future blood meals, where the mosquito-based life cycle continues. In the mosquito, the ingested gametocytes generate zygotes in the mosquito\u2019s gut. Those zygotes undergo development, embed into the mosquito\u2019s midgut wall, and mature into oocytes. Oocytes develop and in turn rupture, releasing the sporozoite form of the parasite. The sporozoites travel to and reside in the mosquito\u2019s salivary glands. Then, when the female takes a blood meal, the sporozoites are injected into the host, starting another infection cycle. The mosquito is the vector that transmits pathogens between human hosts. See the below figure and figure caption for an illustrated description of this process. Plasmodium life cycle, adapted from the CDC, Malaria Biology . During a blood meal, a malaria-infected female Anopheles mosquito inoculates sporozoites into the human host (1) . Sporozoites infect liver cells (2) and mature into schizonts (3), which rupture and release merozoites (4). After this initial replication in the liver (exo-erythrocytic schizogony, \u201cA\u201d), the parasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic schizogony, \u201cB\u201d). Merozoites infect red blood cells (5). Some parasites differentiate into sexual erythrocytic stages (gametocytes) (7). The gametocytes are ingested by an Anopheles mosquito during a blood meal (8). The parasites\u2019 multiplication in the mosquito is known as the sporogonic cycle, \u201cC\u201d. While in the mosquito\u2019s stomach, the gametocytes generate zygotes (9). The zygotes in turn become motile and elongated (ookinetes) (10) which invade the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts (11). The oocysts grow, rupture, and release sporozoites (12), which make their way to the mosquito\u2019s salivary glands. Inoculation of the sporozoites into a new human host (1) perpetuates the malaria life cycle. Symptoms \u00b6 All the clinical symptoms associated with malaria are caused by the asexual erythrocytic (or blood stage) parasites. Malaria has a long incubation period, so symptoms do not develop immediately after a person has been bitten by an infectious mosquito; they can occur 7 days after infection, but this may vary up to 30 days. Symptoms of malaria range in severity, but include fever, headache, body-ache, chills, and vomiting. Severe malaria can develop when the infection is not treated, and may result in organ failure or even death. Examples of severe malaria include cerebral malaria, severe anemia, respiratory distress (due to accumulated fluid in the lungs), kidney failure, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and other maladies. Death can occur from anemia, hypoglycemia, or cerebral malaria (where capillaries leading to the brain are blocked; typically resulting in coma, brain damage or learning disabilities). Confirmed diagnosis of malaria is done through observation of parasites in the blood, as seen on the below microscopic image. In highly endemic areas, treatment typically occurs prior to diagnostic confirmation, as malaria is more easily cured with prompt treatment.

Prevention & control efforts \u00b6 There are numerous types of strategies used to control malaria. As a vector-borne disease, there are multiple stages at which the transmission cycle can be broken. Vector control: strategies that take into account vector ecology. These include: Chemical control, such as insecticide spraying or use of larvicides. Reduction of or elimination of mosquito larval habitat, through drainage or use of biological controls. Potential use of genetic modification (with tools such as CRISPR ) to create mosquitoes that are resistant to infection from Plasmodium parasites. Potential use of the bacterium Wolbachia to prevent mosquitoes from becoming infectious. Personal protection: strategies that avoid infection (by avoiding bites by infectious mosquitoes), or by preventing disease. These include: The use of insecticide-treated nets (ITN) Administration of antimalarial drugs to particularly vulnerable groups, such as children or pregnant women Global malaria burden \u00b6 While progress towards reducing the malaria burden has been largely successful, malaria nevertheless remains a major health problem and target of focused, global efforts for elimination and eradication. According to the CDC, 3.2 billion people worldwide are at risk of malaria. In 2015, there were 214 million cases with 483,000 deaths. Malaria is especially harmful to children: more than 70% of all malaria deaths occur in children under the age of 5. To put that in perspective, a child dies from malaria roughly every 2 minutes. While malaria is a global problem, the burden is not distributed equally across the globe. Sub-Saharan Africa experiences a disproportionately high burden, with about 76% of all cases and 75% of all deaths. South East Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East are also at high risk for malaria. Benefits of mathematical models in malaria control and eradication \u00b6 Controlling and eventual eradication of malaria will require multifaceted and geographically-specific intervention efforts. Heterogeneity in transmission, and transmission potential, creates a need for combinations of interventions that can adapt to the particular malaria epidemiology of the target area. For malaria, mathematical modeling and simulations are key to achieving eradication. Species- specific vector ecology is a fundamental driver of transmission, and transmission also impacted by the interactions of climate, human behavior, and land usage, across varying spatial scales. Modeling these factors enables accurate representations of baseline transmission, which in turn provides a platform to test various interventions (such as insecticide-treated nets (ITN) , indoor residual spraying (IRS) , or mass drug administration (MDA) ) and combinations of interventions. These simulation results can inform policy to develop effective\u2013and cost effective\u2013strategies by exploring the many possible dimensions of coverage, frequency of distribution, and combinations of interventions targeted to particular locations. It should be noted that such a multifaceted and integrated approach to vector control and health management is the most likely path towards elimination, as heavy reliance on singular approaches can be problematic. For example, vector control has been widely implemented and quite successful; however, mosquitoes are developing resistance to pyrethroids, one of the most common classes of insecticides currently recommended for ITN or IRS to control mosquito populations. Through modeling approaches, researchers will be able to develop strategies that lessen dependence on particular insecticides while maintaining successful control efforts. A brief history of malaria modeling \u00b6 Malaria has a long history of posing risks to public health, and as such, also has long been the target of mathematical models tasked with providing solutions to ease the burden. For a more detailed history of malaria models, see Smith et al. PLOS Pathogens 2012 8(4) , and Smith et al. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg 2014 108(4) . The EMOD malaria model builds upon this rich history of disease modeling to provide a novel and rigorous approach to help guide efforts towards malaria elimination and eradication. To fully understand the strengths of EMOD, it is helpful to understand the modeling background from which EMOD developed. Arguably, the quantitative analysis of mosquito-borne diseases, specifically malaria, began with Ronald Ross. In 1897 Ross confirmed that mosquitoes serve as the vector for malaria parasites, and embarked on a career focused on disease prevention through vector control. Further, Ross developed the modeling framework that serves as the basis for studying malaria transmission dynamics. Ross\u2019s work inspired researchers focused on controlling mosquito-borne diseases. His emphasis on the development of metrics useful for measuring the intensity of transmission led to the development of :term:` entomological inoculation rate (EIR)` and motivated research aimed at understanding mosquito movement and the relevant spatial scales for mosquito ecology. Later, in the 1950s, George MacDonald formalized Ross\u2019s models, and introduced the concepts of vectorial capacity and reproductive number . This framework is now known as the Ross-Macdonald model, and is still widely implemented in current modeling work. In fact, the vast majority of models created in the last 40 years share most of their assumptions with the Ross-Macdonald model (see Reiner et al. 2013, Journal of the Royal Society Interface .) The Garki project \u00b6 The Garki project was a major milestone in malaria research. From 1969 to 1976 this study was conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the local government of the Jigawa State, Nigeria, to understand the impacts of indoor residual spraying (IRS) and mass drug administration (MDA) on malaria transmission, as well as to evaluate the utility of mathematical modeling. While the interventions used did not interrupt transmission at the desired level, the model proved to be a success. The epidemiology of the Plasmodium parasite was realistically replicated, even with a simplistic model, and as a result understanding of the parasite\u2019s epidemiology was greatly increased. While the project was largely considered a failure in terms of malaria control, much was gained from the project. Basic tenets of malaria control were learned\u2013 namely, that malaria ecology needs to be fundamentally altered: either by modification of mosquito ecology, or by changing human ecology such as by improving housing conditions. Superinfection , a fundamental malaria concept modeled by Macdonald in his first malaria model publication [Macdonald-1950] , was more correctly described by Dietz [Dietz-1974] . Further, the data set from the project is publicly available, and has become a fundamental tool for use in malaria modeling. For more information on this project, see The Garki Project . Moving forward \u00b6 The Ross-Macdonald model, while extremely useful and influential, has some shortcomings. The model assumes homogeneous transmission within a well-mixed population. Host-vector ratios and numerous aspects of mosquito feeding and development biology is assumed to remain constant. Further, all hosts are assumed to be identical, with equal exposure to pathogens, and the probability of transmission is proportional to host and vector densities. Interestingly, despite work demonstrating that these assumptions are not realistic, many models still utilize them. To improve on the Ross- Macdonald model, it is necessary to understand and implement increased complexity into the transmission dynamics of the model. Transmission dynamics are not linear, and instead depend on fine-scale heterogeneities; ecological as well as social contexts are extremely relevant for potential host-vector interactions, and both human and mosquito movement across relevant spatial scales also impact malaria transmission. Modern research has continued to improve our understanding of both parasite biology (and genetics) as well as within-host immune system interactions. To fully understand the complex nature of malaria epidemiology and how to control it, it is important to include these aspects into models. The malaria EMOD leverages the history of malaria modeling by staring with these important fundamentals and building upon them. EMOD combines detailed vector population dynamics and interactions with human populations, and includes microsimulations for human immunity and within- host parasite dynamics. The model builds on the work of Ross and MacDonald, leverages the Garki model, and incorporates current modeling efforts to model multiple vector species simultaneously interacting with a human population.

Symptoms indicate the presence of disease, and one of the most prevalent types of data used to inform models is case data. By leveraging such data, models can help elucidate the processes that cause disease and enable calculations of the likely percent of the population that is infected (or infectious). Similarly, in order to model treatment-seeking behaviors (which will change the transmission dynamics of malaria), it is necessary to have a spectrum of disease severity (and hence, a spectrum of symptom parameters). Finally, disease severity is related to past infection and immune response, so inclusion of symptoms can help to further inform transmission dynamics of the target population.

The vector model inherits the same human-infection model structure from the generic simulation type: uninfected, latent incubation, infectious, multiple immune variables, and super-infection. However, the transmission of infections is not between individual humans, but rather via the human-to-vector and vector-to-human pathways. The model is a closed-loop feeding cycle where a successful vector (mosquito) feeds (both indoors and outdoors), mates, then produce eggs which become larva and then adult mosquitoes. For example, vector blood-feeding branches into various probabilities that are calculated once per time step . These calculations are based on species parameters and aggregated vector interventions (see feeding decision tree ). Vector transmission can be thought of in terms of vector ecology, and in the EMOD framework is comprised of several components: 1. Vector tracking and the mosquito life-cycle , 2. mosquito behavior, which involves feeding (see Modeling feeding cycle outcomes ), and 3. transmission of malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites between humans and mosquitoes (see Transmission between humans and vectors ). Each of these components is described in more detail below. For a complete list of configuration parameters that are used in the malaria model, see the Configuration parameters . Vector tracking and the mosquito life-cycle \u00b6 Populations are tracked as cohorts throughout the full mosquito life-cycle: From eggs to larvae with a temperature-dependent development period preceding emergence A brief immature phase including sugar-feeding and mating Repeating multi-day gonotrophic cycles during which mosquitoes may be exposed to infection by gametocytes A temperature-dependent latency for sporogony Life-cycle progression is modulated through a set of required species-specific parameters. Vector life cycle Modeling feeding cycle outcomes \u00b6 Adult vectors enter a cycle of host-seeking, feeding, and egg-laying that continues until death. Successful vector blood-feeding branches into various probabilities that are calculated once per time step . These calculations are based on species parameters (for example, An. arabiensis has a higher propensity to feed outdoors or on livestock) and aggregated vector interventions. Various feeding cycle outcomes are calculated from branching trees of conditional probabilities, and individual interventions modulate the probability of choosing between branches. Feeding cycle outcomes include: Death before, during, or after feeding Host unavailable Successful human feed The allocation of mosquitoes to feeding-cycle outcomes is based on end-state probabilities that have been aggregated over the individual humans in the simulation. Multiple simultaneous interventions can target various branches in the vector feeding tree. For example, when both indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are applied against indoor host-seeking mosquitoes, IRS can discourage mosquitoes from entering the house and kill mosquitoes before feeding. The fraction of mosquitoes that survive can be blocked by the ITN, which may also kill a subset of the blocked fraction. Those mosquitoes who survive the feeding attempt may be killed by IRS post-feed. This is how deterrent and toxic effects of multiple interventions can be represented simultaneously. To interact with these parameters and visualize the workings of this microsolver, see the decision tree visualization below: To get started, press the play button. You can also pause the visualization at any time. Parameters in blue are vector species parameters, while parameters in green are types of campaign interventions. Information on these parameters can be found in Configuration parameters and Campaign parameters . The two pink points on the tree illustrate when transmission of malaria parasites is possible. When the simulation starts, the initial mosquito population is set at 100 individuals. The starting population for day two has an initial seeding of 50 mosquitoes, and also includes all mosquitoes that either live without feeding or feed and oviposit. The simulation includes parameters that determine the lifespan of mosquitoes and the time it takes for oviposited eggs to hatch and mature to adulthood. As time progresses, the population will be comprised of only mosquitoes that are generated through the oviposition cycle in the model. The counters on the right side of the visualization keep track of current and total mosquitoes that have \u201cspawned\u201d (generated in the simulation), died, lived without feeding, and fed and oviposited. As an example, let\u2019s simulate Anopheles gambiae . Set Life_Expectancy to 10 (most are thought to live approximately 1-2 weeks in nature), Egg_to_Adult to 5 (this is their minimum duration in the aquatic phase), Days_between_Feeds to 3, and Anthropophily and Indoor_Feeding_Fraction to 0.8. These mosquitoes prefer to primarily feed on humans, and preferentially feed indoors. Now, by changing the interventions, you can see how effective interventions (or combinations of interventions) need to be in order to disrupt (and reduce) mosquito feeding and oviposition. Note that the slider bars for interventions range from 0 - 1, with 1 conferring 100% effectiveness. When mosquito ecology is sufficiently disrupted, malaria transmission can be controlled. You can also manipulate the species parameters to see how mosquito ecology impacts the need for particular types of interventions. If you are interested in simulating other mosquito species, more information on their relevant attributes can be found in the articles Made-to-measure malaria vector control strategies: rational design based on insecticide properties and coverage of blood resources for mosquitoes , by Killeen et al ., 2014, Malaria Journal 13:146, and A global bionomic database for the dominant vectors of human malaria , by Massey et al ., 2016, Nature . Transmission between humans and vectors \u00b6 Transmission between humans and vectors can only occur when mosquitoes successfully feed on humans (see Modeling feeding cycle outcomes ). Infectious humans can infect susceptible mosquitoes when mosquitoes ingest gametocytes during the blood meal. Conversely, infectious mosquitoes can infect susceptible humans by injecting sporozoites into the blood during feeding. Infectiousness of individuals to mosquitoes is proportional to the number of mature gametocytes absorbed in a blood meal, but modulated by a factor that inactivates gametocytes at high cytokine densities. Peak infectiousness typically follows peak parasitemia by about ten days.

In the configuration file , you must set the Enable_Interventions parameter to 1 and set the Campaign_Filename parameter to the name of the campaign file for the interventions to take place. The campaign file must be in the same directory as the configuration file. The campaign file is hierarchically organized into logical groups of parameters that can have arbitrary levels of nesting. It contains an Events array of campaign events, each of which contains a JSON object describing the event coordinator, which in turn contains a nested JSON object describing the intervention.

ADAPTED_SAMPLING_BY_POPULATION_SIZE For each node, a maximum number of Individual objects is tracked (set in Max_Node_Population_Samples ). If the population is smaller than this number, each person is tracked with a sampling rate of 1; if the population is larger, members of the population are added to the simulation with a probability of Max_Node_Population_Samples / population and sampling weight of population / Max_Node_Population_Samples . This setting is useful for simulations over large geographic areas with large heterogeneities in population density. ADAPTED_SAMPLING_BY_AGE_GROUP The population is binned by age and each age bin is sampled at a different rate as defined by Sample_Rate parameters.

Possible values are: TRACK_ALL_VECTORS Each vector in a node is part of the simulation as a separate object. SAMPLE_IND_VECTORS Each vector object in the simulation represents multiple vectors in the node population. Mosquito_Weight sets the number of mosquitos represented by each object. VECTOR_COMPARTMENTS_NUMBER Does not track every vector individually, but provides a compartment for every possible entry in state space and tracks the number of vectors in each compartment. This successfully accounts for each vector, but does not distinguish between vectors that have identical states, just counts how many identical vectors of each state are present at a location. VECTOR_COMPARTMENTS_PERCENT Similar to VECTOR_COMPARTMENTS_NUMBER, but it only tracks the percentage of the population in each state. Less useful, but included for comparison to other models. { \"Vector_Sampling_Type\" : \"TRACK_ALL_VECTORS\" } Scalars and multipliers \u00b6 The following parameters scale or multiply values set in other areas of the configuration file or input data files .

For example, the number of individuals and the distribution for age, gender, immunity, risk, and mortality. These parameters work closely with the Population dynamics parameters in the configuration file , which are simulation-wide and generally control whether certain events, such as births or deaths, are enabled in a simulation. Generally, you will download a demographics file and modify it to meet the needs of your simulation. Demographics files for several locations are available on the Institute for Disease Modeling (IDM) GitHub EMOD-InputData repository or you can use COMputational Platform Service (COMPS) to generate demographics and other input data files for a particular region. By convention, these are named using the name of the region appended with \u201c_demographics.json\u201d, but you may name the file anything you like. Additionally, you can use more than one demographics file, with one serving as the base layer and the one or more others acting as overlays that override the values in the base layer. This can be helpful if you want to experiment with different values in the overlay without modifying your base file. For more information, see Use demographics overlay files . At least one demographics file is required for every simulation unless you set the parameter Enable_Demographics_Builtin to 1 (one) in the configuration file . This setting does not represent a real location and is generally only used for testing and validating code pathways rather than actual modeling of disease. Demographics files are organized into four main sections: Metadata , NodeProperties , Defaults , and Nodes . The following example shows the skeletal format of a demographics file. { \"Metadata\" : { \"DateCreated\" : \"dateTime\" , \"Tool\" : \"scriptUsedToGenerate\" , \"Author\" : \"author\" , \"IdReference\" : \"Gridded world grump2.5arcmin\" , \"NodeCount\" : 2 }, \"NodeProperties\" : [ {} ], \"Defaults\" : { \"NodeAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualProperties\" : {}, \"Society\" : {} }, \"Nodes\" : [{ \"NodeID\" : 1 , \"NodeAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualProperties\" : {}, \"Society\" : {} }, { \"NodeID\" : 2 , \"NodeAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualProperties\" : {}, \"Society\" : {} }] } All parameters except those in the Metadata and NodeProperties sections below can appear in either the Defaults section or the Nodes section of the demographics file. Parameters under Defaults will be applied to all nodes in the simulation. Parameters under Nodes will be applied to specific nodes, overriding the values in Defaults if they appear in both. Each node in the Nodes section is identified using a unique NodeID . The tables below contain only parameters available when using the malaria simulation type . Note Parameters are case-sensitive. For Boolean parameters, set to 1 for true or 0 for false. JSON does not permit comments, but you can add \u201cdummy\u201d parameters to add contextual information to your files. Collapse all parameter tables Contents Metadata NodeProperties and IndividualProperties Transitions NodeAttributes IndividualAttributes Simple distributions Complex distributions Metadata \u00b6 Metadata provides information about data provenance. NodeCount and IdReference are the only parameters used by EMOD, but you are encouraged to included information for your own reference. For example, author, date created, tool used, and more are commonly included in the Metadata section. You can include any information you like here provided it is in valid JSON format. If you generate input data files using COMPS, the following IdReference values are possible and indicate how the NodeID values are generated: Gridded world grump30arcsec Nodes are approximately square regions defined by a 30-arc second grid and the NodeID values are generated from the latitude and longitude of the northwest corner. Gridded world grump2.5arcmin Nodes are approximately square regions defined by a 2.5-arc minute grid and the NodeID values are generated from the latitude and longitude of the northwest corner. Gridded world grump1degree Nodes are approximately square regions defined by a 1-degree grid and the NodeID values are generated from the latitude and longitude of the northwest corner. The algorithm for encoding latitude and longitude into a NodeID is as follows: unsigned int xpix = math . floor (( lon + 180.0 ) / resolution ) unsigned int ypix = math . floor (( lat + 90.0 ) / resolution ) unsigned int ** NodeID ** = ( xpix << 16 ) + ypix + 1 This generates a NodeID that is a 4-byte unsigned integer; the first two bytes represent the longitude of the node and the second two bytes represent the latitude. To reserve 0 to be used as a null value, 1 is added to the NodeID as part of the final calculation. Toggle parameter table Parameter Data type Minimum Maximum Default Description Example IdReference string NA NA NA The identifier for a simulation; all input data files used in a simulation must have the same IdReference value. The value must be greater than 0.

Properties can be thought of as tags that are assigned to nodes or individuals and can then be used to either target interventions to nodes or individuals with certain properties (or prevent them from being targeted). For example, you could define individual properties for disease risk and then target an intervention to only those at high risk. Similarly, you could define properties for node accessibility and set lower intervention coverage for nodes that are difficult to access. For more information on setting up properties, see Configure heterogeneity using individual and node properties . The NodeProperties section is a top-level section at the same level as Defaults and **Nodes that contains parameters that assign properties to nodes in a simulation. The IndividualProperties section is under either Defaults or Nodes and contains parameters that assign properties to individuals in a simulation.

Used only with the Age_Bin property type. The first number must be 0, the last must be -1, and they must be listed in ascending order. Cannot be used with NodeProperties . EMOD automatically create the individual property Age_Bin with values based on the bin edges using the format Age_Bin_Property_From_X_To_Y . These appear in the property reports and can be used to target campaign interventions using Property_Restrictions_Within_Node . See Target interventions to nodes or groups for more information. The following example creates three age groups: 0 to 5, older than 5 to 13, and older than 13 to the maximum age. { \"Defaults\" : { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"Property\" : \"Age_Bin\" , \"Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years\" : [ 0 , 5 , 13 , -1 ] }] } } IndividualProperties array of objects NA NA NA An array that contains parameters that add properties to individuals in a simulation.

The rows represent the infectious individuals (the \u201cwhom\u201d); the columns represent the susceptible individuals (the \u201cwho\u201d). This implements the HINT feature, which is available only in the generic simulation type. For more information, see Configure heterogeneous disease transmission .

For age distributions, it lists in ascending order the ages at which to bin the population. The corresponding values in DistributionValues represent the proportion of the population that is below that age. If the first member of the array is non-zero, the first bin is defined as those with that exact value (EMOD does not assume the bins start at zero). For all other distributions, an array in which each row represents the values for a combination of axes. For example, a mortality distribution that includes both gender and age axes will have a row for males and a row for females that each contain the mortality rate at various ages set in PopulationGroups .

The parameter descriptions are intended to guide you in correctly configuring simulations to match your disease scenario of interest. The reference section contains only the parameters supported for use with the malaria simulation type. To see the parameters for a different simulation type, see the corresponding documentation. These parameters include three major groups: parameters for the demographics file , parameters for the configuration file , and parameters for the campaign file . If you would rather use a text file for parameter reference than this web documentation, you can also generate a schema with the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) that defines all configuration and campaign parameters that can be used in a simulation, including names, data types, defaults, ranges, and short descriptions. For instructions, see Generate a list of all available parameters (a schema) . JSON formatting overview \u00b6 All of these parameters are contained in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted files. JSON is a data format that is human-readable and easy for software to read and generate. It can be created and edited using a simple text editor. JSON has two basic structures: a collection of key-value pairs or an ordered list of values (an array). These structures are within a JSON object, which is enclosed in a set of braces. You will notice that each of these files begins with a left brace ({) and ends with a right brace (}). A value can be a string, number, Boolean, array, or an object. The campaign and data input files often use nested objects and arrays. See www.json.org for more information on JSON. A few important details to call out when creating JSON files: Add a comma after every key-value pair or array except for the last key-value pair in an array or object. The keys (parameters) are case-sensitive. For example, \u201cNodeID\u201d is not the same as \u201cNodeId\u201d. Decimals require a 0 (zero) before the decimal point. EMOD does not support Booleans (\u201cTrue\u201d, \u201cFalse\u201d). Instead, EMOD use the integer 1 for \u201cTrue\u201d and 0 for \u201cFalse\u201d. Every opening brace or bracket ({ or [) requires a corresponding closing brace or bracket (} or ]). The following is an example of a JSON formatted file. { \"A_Complex_Key\" : { \"An_Array_with_a_Nested_Object_Value\" : [ { \"A_Simple_Key\" : \"Value\" , \"A_Simple_Array\" : [ \"Value1\" , \"Value2\" ], \"An_Array_with_Number_Values\" : [ 0.1 , 0.2 ], \"A_Nested_Object\" : { \"Another_Simple_Key\" : \"Value\" , \"Nested_Arrays\" : [ [ 10 , 0.1 ], [ 0.1 , 1 ] ] } } ] } } Demographics parameters Configuration parameters Campaign parameters Events and event coordinators Node-level interventions Individual-level interventions Waning effect classes Event list", "tags": "", "title": "EMOD parameter reference \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./search-local.html", "text": "Search results \u00b6", "tags": "", "title": "Search results \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./search.html", "text": "Please activate JavaScript to enable the search functionality.", "tags": "", "title": "Search \u2014 Malaria Model  documentation"}, {"url": "./troubleshooting.html", "text": "Troubleshooting EMOD simulations \u00b6 If you encounter any of the following problems when attempting to run EMOD simulations, see the information below to resolve the issue.

When submitting the issue, please include any error information. See Debugging and testing for troubleshooting issues when attempting to build Eradication.exe or Eradication binary. Contents Exceptions BadEnumInSwitchStatementException BadMapKeyException CalculatedValueOutOfRangeException ConfigurationRangeException DllLoadingException FactoryCreateFromJsonException FileIOException FileNotFoundException GeneralConfigurationException IllegalOperationException IncoherentConfigurationException InitializationException InvalidInputDataException MissingParameterFromConfigurationException MPIException NotYetImplementedException NullPointerException OutOfRangeException QueryInterfaceException SerializationException CentOS on Azure environment Regression test graphs differ when run on CentOS on Azure Eradication binary cannot locate the input data files Exceptions \u00b6 Whenever EMOD encounters an error condition while running a simulation, it should throw an exception. These exceptions are designed to help you diagnose any problems so that you can quickly resolve the issue. You can find the exceptions code in the utils directory of the EMOD source code within the files Exceptions.h and Exceptions.cpp. Each exception will return, at a minimum, the following information: Exception type caught The filename where the exception occurred The line number in the file where the exception was thrown (which may not be exactly where the error actually occurred in the code) The function name where the exception was thrown Specific exceptions may also return additional information in a message format. This message (msg) may contain variable names or the values of those variables, the name of a file that wasn\u2019t found, and other informational text regarding the nature of the problem. For example, a file not found exception (FileNotFoundException) might look similar to the following: 00 : 00 : 00 [ 0 ] [ E ] [ Eradication ] FileNotFoundException caught : msg = Could not find file ./ Namawala_single_node_demographics . compiled . json , filename = NodeDemographics . cpp , lineNumber = 227 BadEnumInSwitchStatementException \u00b6 This exception is thrown when an enumeration value is not handled in the switch statement. In other words, this exception signals that there is a problem with an enumeration value, typically stemming from one of the configuration files, though this is not always the case. It is possible the enumeration value is not a valid value (out of range of the numeric range of the enumeration), or perhaps the string value is currently not implemented in the code (and should not be used in configuration settings yet). BadMapKeyException \u00b6 This exception is thrown when there is a standard template library (STL) mapping error. Usually, this occurs where spatial output channel names are specified in the configuration file if an unrecognized channel name is used. If you have not modified the EMOD source code or used an unrecognized channel name, this error could signal an internal problem with the code. Contact support @ idmod . org . CalculatedValueOutOfRangeException \u00b6 EMOD performs a large number of mathematical operations on parameter values. Therefore, it is possible that, despite original parameter values being with range, the values resulting from these multiple calculations may end up outside its valid range. For example, a probability value (range: 0 to 1.0) that after multiple calculations during a simulation now exceeds 1.0. This exception is thrown when such a situation is detected. This exception only applies to numeric or Boolean values, not enumeration values. ConfigurationRangeException \u00b6 This exception is thrown if a parameter value read from a configuration file is detected to be outside its valid range. This exception is similar to the more general case OutOfRangeException. However, this exception is only thrown if the out of range exception comes from a numeric or Boolean value, not enumeration value, read from a configuration file. DllLoadingException \u00b6 The EMOD architecture is modularized and can be built as a core Eradication.exe along with a series of custom reporter EMODules, as opposed to a single monolithic Eradication.exe. This exception indicates that EMOD couldn\u2019t load on of the EMODule DLLs. This situation could occur for several reasons: EMOD couldn\u2019t find the EMODule Unresolved symbols were found (Windows) EMOD could not find the necessary symbol during the GetProcAddress call The custom reporter EMODules were built using a version of Visual Studio that is no longer supported. Rebuild the EMODules using Visual Studio 2015 (Professional, Premium, or Ultimate). FactoryCreateFromJsonException \u00b6 EMOD implements class factories that instantiate objects at run time and use information from JSON- based configuration information in the creation of these objects. The exception indicates something is incorrect with the JSON information. In particular, in some cases, the JSON information is nested into a hierarchy of information. Therefore, as the factories are called to create the objects described by the outer layers of one of these nested hierarchies, the factories do not have any knowledge yet of the inner layers of the hierarchies. This inner information contains information the factory needs to complete the object instantiation, but this information might not be correct. If that happens, then the factory will throw this exception. Campaign files often have this kind of nested hierarchical structure, so it\u2019s important to t verify that the hierarchy is set up correctly. For example, if the class name were mistyped and EMOD had no implementation of that class, this exception will be thrown. FileIOException \u00b6 This exception is generated if there is an unrecoverable problem loading data from a file. The data might be corrupted or there may be a mismatch. For example, if the file format or configuration information indicates that there should be ten values of some array and there are only nine included in the file, then this exception would be thrown. This exception is not the same as the exception thrown for a file that is not found. In this case, the file is found and loaded, but there is a problem with the data in the file. FileNotFoundException \u00b6 This exception is thrown if a file cannot be found. Possible causes might include a incorrectly typed filename in the configuration file, a wrong path to the file, or even the path not being set in the system environment leading to the system not finding a relative path to the file. One of the most likely causes is that quotes are missing around the file name. GeneralConfigurationException \u00b6 This exception is only thrown if a more specific exception cannot be used for the configuration problem detected. This exception is likely thrown when there is very little information available about the root problem. For example, this exception might be thrown if a parameter name is invalid, such as using an older, deprecated version of a parameter name. IllegalOperationException \u00b6 This exception is thrown if an illegal operation was detected. In most cases, a more specific exception will be thrown rather than this more general one. This exception is likely thrown when there is very little information available about the root problem. For example, when a utility function error is detected, there is very sparse information available as to what may have led to the error. As a result, calling a more specific exception with more context is not an option. IncoherentConfigurationException \u00b6 This exception is thrown if mutually contradictory or incompatible configuration settings have been detected. For example, if mutually exclusive parameters are set, the minimum parameter value is greater than the maximum value, or two distribution axes are specified in a demographics file but there is a mismatch with the number of axes scale factors included. The exception can also occur if there isn\u2019t a corresponding mapping between an reference ID in the metadata of a demographics file and its corresponding data file. InitializationException \u00b6 This exception is thrown if a problem with initialization was detected. In most cases, a more specific exception will be thrown rather than this more general one. This exception is likely thrown when there is very little information available about the root problem. For example, if the very first part of a JSON file has corrupted or badly formatted data, this exception may be thrown instead of the more expected file input/output exception, FileIOException. InvalidInputDataException \u00b6 This exception is thrown when a problem with an input data file is detected. For example, if the wrong data type was detected, such as a float being detected when a string is expected you would see this exception thrown, or even, if a parameter has an invalid value even if the value is of the correct type. As the input data file most likely to have significant modifications, verify that the demographics file is set up correctly. MissingParameterFromConfigurationException \u00b6 This exception occurs when required parameters are missing. Verify that you are not using deprecated parameters and that all required parameters are specified (or set Use_Defaults to 1). MPIException \u00b6 This exception is thrown if there is an MPI error. As such, these types of issues are related to interfacing with MPI (and/or networking issues) and do not necessary imply something wrong with the EMOD code or JSON files. NotYetImplementedException \u00b6 This exception is thrown if an attempt is made to execute code that is not yet implemented. For example, there are areas of EMOD where placeholder enumeration values are defined but not yet implemented. If you specify a value like this, it is considered within a valid range, but this exception will be thrown in response. Verify that any enumeration values use one of the available values as described in the documentation and do not contain any typos. NullPointerException \u00b6 This exception is thrown when a NULL pointer is detected in the code, or rather when a NULL pointer - that should NOT be NULL - is used. When thrown at the application level, a NULL pointer exception is usually caused by some sort of initialization error, for example, a file not being found. As a result, in most cases, a more specific exception will be thrown before the code execution reaches a point where this exception would occur. Therefore, this exception is uncommon and likely thrown only when there is very little information available about the root problem. OutOfRangeException \u00b6 This exception is thrown when a numeric or Boolean value is out of range. For example, if you index an array outside of its valid range, this exception will be thrown. There are other situations where more specific exceptions are thrown instead of this more general one. For example, when the numeric or Boolean values are from a configuration file, but are detected to be out of range, the ConfigurationRangeException is thrown. Likewise, if the value goes out of range as the result of a calculation, the CalculatedValueOutOfRangeException is thrown instead. QueryInterfaceException \u00b6 The EMOD architecture is modularized and many components now implement QueryInterface . This exception is thrown when a required interface is queried on an object and the object that returns that the interface is not supported. If you have not modified the EMOD source code and receive this error, it could signal an internal problem with the code. Contact support @ idmod . org . SerializationException \u00b6 This exception is thrown when there is a serialization (or de-serialization) issue. For example, if data is being passed over the network (MPI) and the connection drops, then the serialization fails and this exception is thrown. CentOS on Azure environment \u00b6 The following problems are specific to running simulations using the Eradication binary on CentOS 7.1 on Azure. Regression test graphs differ when run on CentOS on Azure \u00b6 After you run regression simulations on CentOS on Azure using runemod.sh in the Scripts directory, it plots graphs from the simulation output data with a red line for the reference output and a blue line for the new output. The reference output was created by running the simulation on Windows, which in some cases may be slightly different than the output from CentOS on Azure. For simulations that plot a baseline, you can override the Windows reference output by modifying runemod.sh to use output/InsetChart.linux.json as the output location. In that case, the red reference plots should always be completely covered by the blue plots. Eradication binary cannot locate the input data files \u00b6 If you chose not to have the PrepareLinuxEnvironment.sh script download the EMOD source code and input data files, you need to set up the environment variable, path and symlink that are needed to run simulations on CentOS on Azure.

New demographics parameters \u00b6 In all simulation types, you can now assign properties like risk or quality of care to nodes using NodeProperties , which are configured much like IndividualProperties . In addition, a new property type is available for both nodes and individuals called InterventionStatus , which is used by the campaign file to distribute interventions based on the other interventions an individual or node has received. This property type was previously available only for individuals in the HIV simulation type and was known as the CascadeState . The relevant campaign parameters are described in the next section. For more information, see the table below. Toggle parameter table Parameter Data type Minimum Maximum Default Description Example NodeProperties array of objects NA NA NA An array that contains parameters that add properties to nodes in a simulation. For example, you can define values for intervention status, risk, and other properties and assign values to different nodes. { \"NodeProperties\" : [{ \"Property\" : \"Risk\" , \"Values\" : [ \"HIGH\" , \"MEDIUM\" , \"LOW\" ], \"Initial_Distribution\" : [ 0.1 , 0.4 , 0.5 ] }] } Property enum NA NA NA The individual or node property type for which you will assign arbitrary values to create groups. You can then move individuals or nodes into or out of different groups or target interventions to particular groups. Possible values are: Age_Bin Assign individuals to age bins. Use with Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years . Cannot be used with NodeProperties . Accessibility Tag individuals or nodes based on their accessibility. Geographic Tag individuals or nodes based on geographic characteristics. HasActiveTB Tag individuals or nodes based on active TB status. Typically used only with HIV ART staging interventions. InterventionStatus Tag individuals or nodes based on intervention status, so that receiving an intervention can affect how other interventions are distributed. Use with Disqualifying_Properties and New_Property_Value in the campaign file. Place Tag individuals or nodes based on place. Risk Tag individuals or nodes based on disease risk. QualityofCare Tag individuals or nodes based on the quality of medical care. { \"Defaults\" : { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"Property\" : \"Age_Bin\" , \"Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years\" : [ 0 , 6 , 10 , 20 , -1 ] }] } } { \"NodeProperties\" : [{ \"Property\" : \"InterventionStatus\" , \"Values\" : [ \"NONE\" , \"RECENT_SPRAY\" ], \"Initial_Distribution\" : [ 1.0 , 0.0 ] }] } New campaign parameters \u00b6 The addition of NodeProperties in the demographics file also necessitated the addition of Node_Property_Restrictions to control how interventions are distributed based on the property values assigned to each node. The new campaign parameters Disqualifying_Properties and New_Property_Value were added to every intervention to control how interventions are distributed based on properties assigned to individuals or nodes. Disqualifying_Properties prevents an intervention from being distributed to individuals or nodes with certain property values. New_Property_Value updates the property value after they receive an intervention. These are generally used with the the property type InterventionStatus to control how interventions are distributed based on the interventions already received. For example, a household may be ineligible for clinical treatment for a length of time if they already received treatment during a drug campaign. This functionality was previously only available for individuals in the HIV simulation type and used parameters previously called Abort_States and Valid_Cascade_States . The following event coordinators and intervention classes are new for this simulation type. CommunityHealthWorkerEventCoordinator \u00b6 The CommunityHealthWorkerEventCoordinator coordinator class is used to model a health care worker\u2019s ability to distribute interventions to the nodes and individual in their coverage area. This coordinator distributes a limited number of interventions per day, and can create a backlog of individuals or nodes requiring the intervention. For example, individual-level interventions could be distribution of drugs and node-level interventions could be spraying houses with insecticide.

If a person or node is in the queue, they will not be re-added to the queue if the event that would add them to the queue occurs. This allows them to maintain their priority, however they could be removed from the queue due to this waiting period. { \"Waiting_Period\" : 15 } Property_Restrictions array of JSON objects NA NA NA A list of the IndividualProperty key:value pairs, as defined in the demographics file, that individuals must have to be targeted by this individual-level intervention.

Rather than importing a deterministic number of cases on a scheduled day, ImportPressure applies a set of per-day rates of importation of infected individuals, over a corresponding set of durations.

Rather than attaching a persistent vaccine intervention object to an individual\u2019s intervention list (as a campaign-individual-multieffectboostervaccine does), the IndividualImmunityChanger directly alters the immune modifiers of the individual\u2019s susceptibility object and is then immediately disposed of.

Upon distribution and successful take, the vaccine\u2019s effect in each immunity compartment (acquisition, transmission, and mortality) is determined by the recipient\u2019s immune state. If the recipient\u2019s immunity modifier in the corresponding compartment is above a user-specified threshold, then the vaccine\u2019s initial effect will be equal to the corresponding priming parameter. If the recipient\u2019s immune modifier is below this threshold, then the vaccine\u2019s initial effect will be equal to the corresponding boost parameter.

You can also define a duration in days before the node property reverts back to its original value, the probability that a node will change its node property to the target value, and the number of days over which nodes will attempt to change their individual properties to the target value.

If the recipient\u2019s immune modifier is below this threshold, then the vaccine\u2019s initial effect will be equal to the corresponding boosting parameter. After distribution, the effect wanes, just like SimpleVaccine .

However, bednet ownership and bednet usage are distinct in this intervention. As in SimpleBednet , net ownership is configured through the demographic coverage, and the blocking and killing rates of mosquitoes are time-dependent. Use of bednets is age-dependent and can vary seasonally. Once a net has been distributed to someone, the net usage is determined by the product of the seasonal and age-dependent usage probabilities until the net-retention counter runs out, and the net is discarded.

With this release, EMOD now uses Visual Studio 2015, Boost 1.61.0, and SCons 2.5.0. EMOD software upgrades \u00b6 Microsoft Visual Studio EMOD now uses Visual Studio 2015, and Visual Studio 2012 is no longer supported. The Visual Studio solution file in the EMOD source, EradicationKernel, has been updated for Visual Studio 2015. If you have custom reporter EMODules (DLLS) that were built using Visual Studio 2012, you will need to rebuild them with Visual Studio 2015; otherwise, your simulation will crash when it attempts to load the DLLs built by Visual Studio 2012. Boost EMOD now supports using Boost 1.61.0. If you continue to use Boost 1.51.0, you will get the following warning, \u201cUnknown compiler version - please run the configure tests and report the results.\u201d Environment variables To make it easier to use Boost and Python with Visual Studio, IDM paths have been created. These two paths, IDM_BOOST_PATH and IDM_PYTHON_PATH, need to be added to your environment variables by using either the setx command from a command line or the Windows System Properties panel. SCons EMOD was tested using SCons 2.5.0, as it supports Visual Studio 2015. If you do not add the new IDM environment variables for Boost and Python, you will need to modify the Boost and Python paths in the SConstruct file in the EMOD root directory. Python EMOD was tested with Python 2.7.11 and 2.7.12. If you are building the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) and have an earlier version of Python (for example, 2.7.2), you will see the following warning message on some files, \u201cc:python27includepymath.h(22): warning C4273: \u2018round\u2019: inconsistent dll linkage.\u201d Upgrade to Python 2.7.11 or 2.7.12 to get rid of the warning message. For more information, see Prerequisites for working with EMOD source code . Malaria model \u00b6 Several habitat parameters in the malaria model have been upgraded, creating more flexibility in the model and enabling the user to have more control over habitat customization. These changes allow the model to more accurately capture real-world habitat availability and how it affects different mosquito species. LINEAR_SPLINE habitat type This new option under Larval_Habitat_Types increases model customization by allowing the user to specify an arbitrary functional form (derived from data) for larval habitat availability throughout the year, instead of relying on climatological parameters such as rainfall or temperature. For more information, see Larval habitat parameters. LarvalHabitatMultiplier by species This new feature in demographics allows larval habitat availability to be modified independently for each species sharing a particular habitat type. Prior versions of EMOD applied the same modifier to all species within a shared habitat; this upgrade enables you to apply modifiers to individual species within a habitat. For more information, see NodeAttributes parameters. ScaleLarvalHabitat by species This new intervention enables species-specific effects of habitat interventions within shared habitat types, such that habitat availability is modified on a per-species level.
