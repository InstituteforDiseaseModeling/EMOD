Generic 1: SIR - Simple single-node outbreak
============================================

This first tutorial is a simple SIR epidemic in a single-:term:`node`, village-scale location. The
tutorial describes the differences between the :term:`stochastic` |EMOD_s| model and the
:term:`deterministic` :term:`SIR model` and demonstrates how the :term:`Epidemiological MODeling
software (EMOD)` is configured to simulate an SIR epidemic.

After running the base simulation of the SIR epidemic, you can vary the parameters for
disease infectivity and infection duration to see the effect on the height of the epidemic peak, the
time to reach the peak, and the cumulative number of disease cases.


The SIR model
=============

The simplest way to model epidemic spread in populations is to classify people into
different population groups or compartments. One of the classic but still widely used models divides
people into three groups: S - susceptible, I - infected/infectious, and R - recovered/immune. This
model was first used by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 and has subsequently been applied to a
variety of diseases, especially airborne childhood diseases with life-long immunity upon recovery,
such as measles, mumps, rubella, and pertussis.

S, I and R represent the number of susceptible,infected, and recovered individuals, and N = S + I +
R is the total population. The infectious rate β controls the rate of spread which represents the
probability of transmitting disease between a susceptible and an infectious individual. Recovery
rate, γ = 1/D, is determined by the average duration, D, of infection.

If the course of the infection is short (emergent outbreak) compared with the life time of an
individual, and the disease is non-fatal, vital dynamics (birth and death) can be ignored. In the
deterministic form, the SIR model can be written as follows:

.. math::

        \begin{aligned}
        \frac{dS}{dt} & = -\frac{\beta SI}{N}\\
        \frac{dI}{dt} & = \frac{\beta SI}{N} - \gamma I\\
        \frac{dR}{dt} & = \gamma I
        \end{aligned}



It is challenging to derive exact analytical solutions of the previous equations because of the non-
linear dynamics. However, the key metrics that control the spread can be derived. At the initial
seeding of the infection, the following condition needs to be satisfied for a disease to spread:

.. math::

        \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta SI}{N} - \gamma I > 0


If the number of infections at the initial stage is small and the initial R = 0 then S is close to N
and the condition becomes:

.. math::

        \frac{\beta}{\gamma} > 1


where β/γ is named the :term:`reproductive number` (R\ :sub:`0`\). R\ :sub:`0`\ is the average number of
secondary cases generated by an index case in a fully susceptible population. The disease will
spread in the population when R\ :sub:`0`\ > 1 and will die out if R\ :sub:`0`\ < 1.


SIR and |EMOD_s| model comparison
=================================

The |EMOD_s| model is a discrete and stochastic version of the SIR model with state
changes occurring at fixed time steps and an exponentially distributed duration of infection. The
discrete form of the previous equation at each :term:`time step` from to  can be written as:

.. math::

        \begin{aligned}
        S(t+\delta) & = S(t) - \delta\frac{\beta S(t)I(t)}{N}\\
        I(t+\delta) & = I(t) + \delta\frac{\beta S(t)I(t)}{N} - \delta\gamma I(t)\\
        R(t+\delta) & = R(t) +\delta\gamma I(t)
        \end{aligned}


The infection and recovery process can be represented as probabilistic binomial draws where:

The total rate of contagion shedding from all infected individuals (the force of infection):

.. math::

        \lambda = \frac{\beta I}{N}


The probability of infection:

.. math::

        p_i = 1-\mathrm{e}^{\lambda\delta}


Probability of recovery:

.. math::

        p_r = 1-\mathrm{e}^{\gamma\delta}



Therefore,

.. math::

        \begin{aligned}
        S(t+\delta) & = S(t) - \mathrm{Binomial}\left(S(t), p_i\right)\\
        I(t+\delta) & = I(t) + \mathrm{Binomial}\left(S(t), p_i\right) - \mathrm{Binomial}\left(I(t), p_r\right)\\
        R(t+\delta) & = R(t) + \mathrm{Binomial}\left(I(t), p_r\right)
        \end{aligned}



Because the |EMOD_s| model is stochastic and discrete, the accuracy of the result will depend on δ which
is set with the parameter **Simulation_Timestep**. By default, δ = 1 which is a day but you can choose a
smaller time step in order to get more accurate results.

One of the key the differences between stochastic and deterministic systems is the value of
R\ :sub:`0`\.  A :term:`ordinary differential equation (ODE)` model will never predict an
outbreak when R\ :sub:`0`\ < 1,  especially when R\ :sub:`0`\  is close to 1. In stochastic simulations
it is possible to see outbreaks.

For more information on the mathematics of the |EMOD_s| model, see `Heterogeneity and transmission scaling`_
in the generic documentation set.

Demographic inputs
==================

The demographic file generic_scenarios_demographics, defines a single node with 10,000 individuals
and has a fixed birth and death rate at 20 per 1000 individual per year (0.0000548 per day). This
demographics file is used by this tutorial and several of the other Generic simulation tutorials.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/generic1-demographics.json
  :language: JSON


For some of the Generic tutorials that use **generic_scenarios_demographics**, including this
tutorial, the birth and death rate needs to be 0. In this case, the birth and death process is
disabled in the :term:`configuration file` (config.json) by setting the parameter **Enable_Vital_Dynamics** to
0.

You can view the demographics file at <path_to_directory>\Scenarios\InputFiles where
<path_to_directory> is the location where either the Quick Start was installed. For more information
on demographics files, see :doc:`intro-inputs`.


Key configuration parameters
============================

You can view the complete config.json at
<path_to_directory>\Scenarios\Generic Scenarios\01_SIR directory.


Demographics parameters
-----------------------

Set **Enable_Vital_Dyanamics** to 0.  This will disable vital dynamics (birth and death) in the simulation.



SIR model setup parameters
--------------------------

The |EMOD_s| generic simulation uses an SEIR-like disease model by default. You can modify the default
SEIR model to an SIR model by turning off the incubation period and immune decay in the config.json
file. For more information, see :ref:`config-generaldisease` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Siumulation_Type** to "GENERIC SIM."
  * Set **Base_Incubation_Period** to 0.
  * Set **Incubation_Period_Distribution** to "FIXED_DURATION."
  * Set **Enable_Immune_Decay** to 0.



Disease parameters
------------------

As demonstrated above, the spread of disease in the SIR model depends on the basic reproductive
number R\ :sub:`0`\ =β/γ .  In this simulation, the average infection duration is 4 days, and
R\ :sub:`0`\ =14  (measles-like). An exponentially distributed period is used to match the behavior of
ODE. For more information, see :ref:`config-generaldisease` parameters.


Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Base_Infectivity** to 3.5.
  * Set **Base_Infectious_Period** to 4.
  * Set **Infectious_Period_Distribution** to "EXPONENTIAL_DURATION."



Simulation duration parameters
------------------------------

The simulation is run for 3 months with a 1-day time step. For more information, see
:ref:`config-simulationsetup` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Simulation_Timestep** to 1.
  * Set **Simulation_Duration** to 90.



Interventions
=============

You can define interventions and events for a simulation through a :term:`JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON)` formatted campaign file, typically called campaign.json.

Interventions can have either a positive effect on a simulation (for example, a vaccination
campaign) or a negative impact (for example, an outbreak). For this simulation, the :term:`intervention` is
an outbreak.


Initial outbreak
----------------

This simulation uses an **OutbreakIndividual** event at day 1 as the initial seeding of the
infection. For more information, see :ref:`iv-outbreakindividual` parameters.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/generic1-intervention.json
  :language: JSON


You can view the complete campaign.json in
<path_to_directory>\Scenarios\Generic Scenarios\01_SIR directory.

Run the simulation
==================

Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see
:doc:`using-quickstart`.


.. include:: ../reuse/note-stochastic.txt


Simulation output graphs
------------------------

*Figure 1: growth of infection and depletion of the susceptible population* is a graph of the
complete course of the outbreak. After the initial fast growth, the epidemic depletes the
susceptible population. Eventually the virus cannot find enough new susceptible people and dies
out.

Exploring the model
===================

The |EMOD_s| model is individual-based, which allows the implementation of a flexible distribution. In
an ODE model the time constants are exponentially distributed, however, this is not case for some
diseases. You can test the effects of different distributions in the |EMOD_s| executable by changing
**Infectious_Period_Distribution** in the configuration file.

Set the value of **Infectious_Period_Distribution** to "FIXED_DURATION" and let all other parameters
remain the same. The following output shows a much faster spread of disease when using a fixed
duration for the infection period.


.. figure:: ../images/generic-tutorials/Generic_SIR_exploring_plotInsetChart_fixed_500x386.png

  Figure 3: Infectious_Period_Distribution is FIXED_DURATION


You can also try the same SIR model with different basic reproductive number values. For example,
run the simulation with R\ :sub:`0`\  equal to 0.2 and 2.0.

* Simulation with R\ :sub:`0`\ =0.2 :  Keep **Base_Infectious_Period** equal to 4 and change
  **Base_Infectivity** to 0.05.
* Simulation with R\ :sub:`0`\ =2.0 :  Keep **Base_Infectious_Period** equal to 4 and change
  **Base_Infectivity** to 0.5.

The following images shows the simulation results with R\ :sub:`0`\  equal to 0.2 and 2.0.


.. figure:: ../images/generic-tutorials/Generic_SIR_exploring_plotInsetChart_0.2_500x386.png

  Figure 4: R\ :sub:`0`\ =0.2   - No Outbreak (*Base_Infectivity* = 0.05)


.. figure:: ../images/generic-tutorials/Generic_SIR_exploring_plotInsetChart_2_500x386.png

  Figure 5: R\ :sub:`0`\ =2.0   - Outbreak (*Base_Infectivity* = 0.5)
