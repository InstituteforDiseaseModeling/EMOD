Generic 10: Animal reservoir zoonosis
=====================================

Zoonosis represents a list of diseases that transmit from animals to humans. They are of particular
interest because typically a zoonosis disease has previously not been in the population, and the
whole population is susceptible. This tutorial demonstrates an animal reservoir, independently of
human infections, reintroducing zoonotic cases at a specified rate.

This tutorial is important because for many zoonotic diseases, there is a background animal
reservoir that continuously exposes humans to infection. In these situations, the interest is not
only in a single large outbreak which can be simulated by an **Outbreak** event, but also in the
population-level dynamics where there is a continuous background rate of introducing a new zoonotic
infection to the human population which can be configured by parameter **Zoonosis_Rate**.

In this tutorial, the rate of infection from the animal reservoir can be adjusted with respect to
the human-to-human infectiousness to vary along a spectrum, from a low rate of primary zoonotic
infection with substantial secondary human transmission to a high zoonosis rate with low human
transmission. This shifts the fraction of cases that are primary zoonotic infections. By varying the
parameter **Zoonosis_Rate**, you can observe the daily rate of zoonotic infection per individual and the
impact of the parameter changes on the outbreak.

Input files
===========

The input files for this tutorial differ from the previous tutorials. The previous tutorials were
simple single-node simulations without migration. This tutorial uses Seattle as an example of a
multi-node simulation with migration rates. The input files include not a only a human population
demographics file but also a zoonosis demographics file and local and regional migration files.

* Seattle_30arcsec_demographics_zoonosis

* Seattle_Seattle_30arcsec_local_migration

* Seattle_Seattle_30arcsec_regional_migration


You can view these files at <path_to_directory>\Scenarios\InputFiles where <path_to_directory> is
the location where the |quick| was installed. For more information on data input files, see
:doc:`intro-inputs`.

Key configuration parameters
============================

This tutorial uses the config.json file in the <path_to_directory>\Scenarios\Generic\10_Zoonosis
directory.

Input file parameters
---------------------

This tutorial uses two demographics files. The first demographics file provides information about
the people in the region while the second provides information on zoonosis. Multiple demographics
file are listed under one parameter. When there is more than one demographics file, the file names
are separated by a semi-colon.

This is a multi-node simulation that also supports migration between the nodes. This simulation
supports only local and regional migration. The input files for the different types of migration are
specified with different parameters.

The following parameters specify the demographic and migration input files. For more information,
see :ref:`config-inputfiles` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Demographics_Filename** to "Seattle_30arcsec_demographics.json;Seattle_30arcsec_demographics_zoonosis.json."

  * Set **Local_Migration__Filename** to "Seattle_30arcsec_local_migration.bin."

  * Set **Regional_Migration_Filename** to "Seattle_30arcsec_regional_migration.bin."



Demographics parameters
-----------------------

The following parameters enable vital dynamics for birth but disable non-disease related death and
disease related deaths. For more information, see :ref:`config-demographics` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Enable_Vital_Dynamics** to 1.

  * Set **Enable_Birth** to 1.

  * Set **Death_Rate_Dependence** to "NONDISEASE_MORTALITY_BY_AGE_AND_GENDER."

  * Set **Enable_Disease_Mortality** to 0.


Migration input file parameters
-------------------------------

The following parameters enable or disable the specific type of migration. For more information, see
:ref:`Migration <config-migration>` parameters.


Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Enable_Air_Migration** to 0.

  * Set **Enable_Local_Migration** to 1.

  * Set **Enable_Regional_Migration** to 1.

  * Set **Enable_Sea_Migration** to 0.

SEIRS model setup parameters
----------------------------

This tutorial uses an :term:`SEIRS model`. The following parameters configure the |EMOD_s| executable to run an
SEIRS-like disease model with person-to-person direct transmission. For more information, see
:ref:`config-generaldisease` parameters.


Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Base_Incubation_Period** to 3.

  * Set **Incubation_Period_Distribution** to "FIXED_DURATION."

  * Set **Enable_Immunity** to 1.

  * Set **Enable_Immune_Decay** to 1.

Migration parameters
--------------------

In a multi-node simulation with migration enabled, individuals have a probably of "migrating" to
another node at every time step unless they have already migrated. When an individual has migrated
to another node, they can shed or acquire infection in that node.

The migration pattern for this simulation is configured as "WAYPOINTS_HOME" with
**Roundtrip_Waypoints** set to 1. This means, individuals "migrate" one day and return home the next
day. There are no intermediate nodes between the home and the destination node. For more information,
see :ref:`Migration <config-migration>` parameters.


Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Migration_Model** to "FIXED_RATE_MIGRATION."

  * Set **Migration_Pattern** to "WAYPOINTS_HOME."

  * Set **Roundtrip_Waypoints** to 1.

Disease parameters
------------------

These parameters configure the |EMOD_s| executable to run an SEIRS-like disease model with person-
to- person direct transmission. For more information, see :ref:`config-generaldisease` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Base_Infectivity** to 0.25.

  * Set **Base_Infectious_Period** to 7.

  * Set **Infectious_Period_Distribution** to "FIXED_DURATION."


Zoonosis parameters
-------------------

The following parameters configure the animal zoonosis. The **Zoonosis_Rate** is multiplied with the
**Zoonosis** rate in the demographic file. For more information, see :ref:`config-generaldisease`
parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Animal_Reservoir_Type** to "ZOONOSIS_FROM_DEMOGRAPHICS."

  * Set **Zoonosis_Rate** to 0.005.



Immunity parameters
-------------------

At the time of recovery when the infection is cleared, the values of immunity against acquisition,
transmission, and mortality are multiplied by **Immunity_Acquisition_Factor**,
**Immunity_Transmission_Factor**, and **Immunity_Mortality_Factor** parameters. The default values
are set to 0 in the files, which means full and complete protection against each. For more
information, see :ref:`config-generaldisease` parameters.

In this scenario, people's immunity decays with an average half-life of 33 days and a 400-day
offset. This assumption applies to transmission blocking, acquisition blocking, and mortality
blocking immunity.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Acquisition_Blocking_Immunity_Duration_Before_Decay** to 400.

  * Set **Acquisition_Blocking_Immunity_Decay_Rate** to 0.03.

  * Set **Transmission_Blocking_Immunity_Duration_Before_Decay** to 400.

  * Set **Transmission_Blocking_Immunity_Decay_Rate** to 0.03.

  * Set **Immunity_Acquisition_Factor** to 0.

  * Set **Immunity_Mortality_Factor** to 0.

  * Set **Immunity_Transmission_Factor** to 0.

  * Set **Mortality_Blocking_Immunity_Duration_Before_Decay** to 400.

  * Set **Mortality_Blocking_Immunity_Decay_Rate** to 0.03.


Intervention
============

This simulation uses an **Outbreak** event for repeated infection seeding. This simulation uses the
campaign.json in the <path_to_directory>\Scenarios\Generic\10_Zoonosis directory. For more
information, see :ref:`iv-outbreak` parameters.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/generic10-interventions1.json
  :language: JSON


Run the simulation
==================

Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see
:doc:`using-quickstart`.


.. include:: ../reuse/note-stochastic.txt


Simulation output graphs
------------------------

After the initial outbreak, there are no additional imported cases set in the campaign file.
However, because of the non-zero zoonosis rate, there are several introductions of infections in the
background, as shown in the Log Prevalence chart in Figure 1.

When enough susceptible individuals are accumulated due to immunity waning, one of the seeds starts
a disease outbreak later due to zoonosis (see Figure 1 and Figure 2). The seeding and occasional
outbreaks after the seeding is shown in the following graph plotting infections over time.
