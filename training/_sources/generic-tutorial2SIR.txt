Generic 2: SIR - Targeted vaccination campaigns
===============================================

This tutorial assumes that you have read :doc:`generic-tutorial1SIR`.

This tutorial implements vaccination strategies to control an SIR epidemic in a single-node,
village-scale location. The tutorial demonstrates how to configure vaccination interventions and the
effect of those vaccine interventions on herd immunity.

The tutorial also demonstrates how to target vaccines to heterogeneous groups within the node. By
default, the |EMOD_s| executable assumes every individual has the same probability of being selected for
vaccination. However, it is possible to model certain groups with low or no vaccination coverage
through the use of **IndividualProperties**. **IndividualProperties** is added to the demographics file and
configured to create the groups. For more information see IndividualProperties.

This tutorial consists of three scenarios:

A. Baseline outbreak
B. Vaccination campaigns all individuals
C. Vaccination campaigns targeted groups


Vaccination and herd immunity
=============================

In :doc:`generic-tutorial1SIR`, the :term:`SIR model` assumed all individuals are
susceptible before the importation of an outbreak. However, vaccination is the one of the most
effective ways to prevent or contain a disease outbreak. This scenario demonstrates the effect of
vaccinations.

Starting from the SIR equations discussed in the previous tutorials:

.. math::

        \begin{aligned}
        \frac{dS}{dt} & = -\frac{\beta SI}{N}\\
        \frac{dI}{dt} & = \frac{\beta SI}{N} - \gamma I\\
        \frac{dR}{dt} & = \gamma I
        \end{aligned}


For an outbreak to start, the following condition needs to be satisfied:

.. math::

        \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta SI}{N} - \gamma I > 0



If a vaccination :term:`campaign` with coverage p :math:`\in` [0, 1] is performed before the
outbreak, only a fraction of susceptible people move to the recovered compartment. If the vaccine
take is e :math:`\in` [0, 1], representing the probability of being protected after receiving a
vaccine dose, the fraction of immune people due to vaccination is *ep*. Therefore, the previous
condition can be reduced to:

.. math::

        \begin{aligned}
        \left(\beta (1 - e p) - \gamma\right) I  & > 0\\
        R_0 (1 - e p) & > 1\\
        R_{eff} & > 1
        \end{aligned}


R\ :sub:`eff`\  is also called the effective reproductive number. Vaccination can reduce the
disease's ability to spread, and the outbreak can be prevented or stopped with less than 100%
coverage. When R\ :sub:`eff`\ = 1,  there exists a minimum vaccination coverage that can prevent a
disease outbreak. This minimum coverage required to prevent an outbreak is usually called :term:`herd
immunity` (represented as P\ :sub:`herd`\).  Therefore, the analytical form of P\ :sub:`herd`\  can be
derived based on the previous condition:

.. math::

        p_{herd} = \frac{1}{e}\left(1-\frac{1}{R_0}\right)



Multiple rounds of vaccinations
===============================

If multiple vaccine interventions are performed in the same area, people are selected on a binomial
basis and all individuals have the same probability of being included. If the vaccine coverage is p,
every individual has a probability *p* of being selected in a given round. After the first round,
the fraction of non-vaccinated is 1-*p*, and after *n* rounds this fraction is (1 - p)\ :sup:`n`\.
Therefore, the fraction of people getting at least 1 dose is:

.. math::

        1-(1-p)^n


For example, the fraction of people getting at least one vaccination with a 50% campaign coverage is
shown in the following table. After a few rounds, the coverage increases significantly with the
number of campaigns. Scenario B demonstrates this example.


+---------------------+-----------------------------+
| Number of Campaigns | Covered Fraction (>=1 dose) |
+=====================+=============================+
| 1                   | 50%                         |
+---------------------+-----------------------------+
| 2                   | 75%                         |
+---------------------+-----------------------------+
| 3                   | 87.5%                       |
+---------------------+-----------------------------+
| 4                   | 93.75%                      |
+---------------------+-----------------------------+
| 5                   | 96.875%                     |
+---------------------+-----------------------------+

However, this is usually not the case. In recent polio eradication campaigns, the number of
:term:`supplemental immunization activity (SIA)` campaigns planned in certain high-risk districts is greater
than 6 per year, but poliovirus still persists in the area due to certain groups that are
chronically missed. This can be caused by low accessibility, exclusion from SIA microplans, or
vaccine refusal. R\ :sub:`eff`\  has not been driven below 1 because these susceptible people in the
chronically missed groups are still in contact with the rest of population. In some modeling
simulations, this assumption has to be included.

In this second example, the same 50% campaign coverage is repeated so that the same amount of
vaccine is used. However, 30% of the population is not accessible to any vaccine campaigns. Although
the number of vaccine doses used is the same as the previous example, the overall coverage is much
less. The scenario C demonstrates this example.

+------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
| Number of  | Covered Fraction of | Covered Fraction of | Covered Fraction of   |
| Campaigns  | Total Population    | Groups with Access  | Groups without Access |
+============+=====================+=====================+=======================+
| 1          | 50%                 | 71.43%              | 0%                    |
+------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
| 2          | 29%                 | 91.84%              | 0%                    |
+------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
| 3          | 68.37%              | 97.67%              | 0%                    |
+------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
| 4          | 69.53%              | 99.33%              | 0%                    |
+------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
| 5          | 69.87%              | 99.81%              | 0%                    |
+------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+


Demographics inputs
===================

This simulation uses the demographics file "generic_scenarios_individualproperties_demographics".
Except for an **IndividualProperties** structure, the demographics file is the same as
"generic_scenarios_demographics" used in :doc:`generic-tutorial1SIR`.

Individual Properties
---------------------

An **IndividualProperties** structure is added to **Defaults** in the demographics file. Its purpose for
this scenario is to divide individuals into two groups so the individuals in different groups can be
configured differently. In the third scenario, a vaccine campaign will be targeted at only one of
the groups but not the other group. This models the situation where individuals in the general
population have a chance of receiving a vaccine while the other individuals are in the chronically
missed group.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/generic2-demographics1.json
  :language: JSON


Property and values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **IndividualProperties** structure creates groups using the **Property** and **Values** parameters.

The **Property** parameter specifies the property type.  This tutorial uses the property type
**Accessibility**.

The **Values** array defines the groups. Each element in the array is a group. In this tutorial, the
groups are "Easy" and "Hard". They represent the group that is easy to access during a vaccine campaign
(Easy), and the chronically missed group (Hard).

.. note::

   **Property** and **Values** creates the groups. However, the different behavior of the two
   groups must be configured with parameters in the campaign files.


Initial_Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the beginning of the simulation individuals are assigned a group using the probabilities in the
**Initial_Distribution** array. The values in the **Initial_Distribution** array must be in the same order
as the groups in the **Values** array.

At the beginning of the simulation, each individual has a 70% of belonging to the "Easy" accessibility
group and a 30% chance of belonging to the "Hard" accessibility group as specified by the
**Initial_Distribution** array.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/generic2-demographics2.json
  :language: JSON


.. note::

    **Transitions** is not used in this tutorial but it must be include as an empty array. When the
    simulation is run, it will create an empty **Transitions** output file which can be ignored.

Note that this tutorial only uses **IndividualProperties** to divide the
population into groups. In more complex simulations, **IndividualProperties** can be used to differentiate the
disease transmission between multiple groups within a node. This is described in :doc:`hint-tutorial-overview`.


Key configuration parameters
============================

All three of the scenarios in this tutorial use the same simulation set up. Please note each
subdirectory has a copy of the config.json file. You can view the complete config.json in the
following directories:

* <path_to_directory>\Scenarios\Generic Scenarios\02_SIR_Vaccinations\A_BaselineOutbreak

* <path_to_directory>\Scenarios\Generic Scenarios\02_SIR_Vaccinations\B_VaccinationAll

* <path_to_directory>\Scenarios\Generic Scenarios\02_SIR_Vaccinations\C_TargetedVaccination


Demographics parameters
-----------------------

Set **Enable_Vital_Dyanamics** to 0.  This will disable vital dynamics (birth and death) in the simulation.
For more information, see :ref:`config-demographics` parameters.

SIR model setup parameters
--------------------------

The generic simulation uses an SEIR-like disease model by default. You can modify
the default :term:`SEIR model` to an SIR model by turning off the incubation period and immune decay in the
config.json file. For more information, see :ref:`config-generaldisease` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Base_Incubation_Period** to 0.

  * Set **Incubation_Period_Distribution** to "FIXED_DURATION."

  * Set **Enable_Immune_Decay** to 0.


Disease parameters
------------------

In the following example, we assume the average infection duration is 7 days,
and R\ :sub:`0`\  = 4.9. For more information, see :ref:`config-generaldisease` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Base_Infectivity** to 7.

  * Set **Base_Infectious_Period** to 0.7.

  * Set **Infectious_Period_Distribution** to "EXPONENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION."


Timestep and duration parameters
--------------------------------

For more information, see :ref:`config-simulationsetup` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Simulation_Timestep** to 1.

  * Set **Simulation_Duration** to 120.



Interventions
=============

The three scenarios have different campaign.json files.


A. Baseline outbreak
--------------------

This scenario uses an **OutbreakIndividual** event at day 30 as the initial seeding of the infection.
For more information, see :ref:`iv-outbreakindividual` parameters.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/generic2-interventions1.json
  :language: JSON


You can view the complete campaign.json at
<path_to_directory>\Scenarios\Generic Scenarios\02_SIR_Vaccinations\A_BaselineOutbreak.


B. Vaccinations for all individuals
-----------------------------------

The following campaign event has three vaccination campaigns that are 7 days apart. The campaigns
have a 100% vaccine take rate and a 50% per-campaign coverage. The vaccine is acquisition-blocking
and full immunity lasts for 10 years. For more information, see :ref:`SimpleVaccine <iv-simplevaccine>` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Number_Repetitions** to 3.

  * Set **Timesteps_Between_Repetitions** to 7.

  * Set **Vaccine_Take** to 1.0.

  * Set **Demographic_Coverage** to 3.

  * Set **Vaccine_Type** to "AcquistionBlocking".

  * Set **Simulation_Duration** to 120.

  * Set **Primar_Decay_Time_Constant** to 3650.


You can also view campaign.json at
<path_to_directory>\Scenarios\Generic Scenarios\02_SIR_Vaccinations\B_Vaccinations.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/generic2-interventions2.json
  :language: JSON


C. Vaccination campaigns for targeted groups
--------------------------------------------

The following campaign event is the same as the campaign event in scenario B, but it restricts the
vaccine campaign to the "Easy" accessibility group by adding a **Property_Restrictions** parameter
and setting it to "Accessibility": "Easy". As only 70% of the population is in the "Easy"
accessibility group, vaccine coverage is also reduced.

Run the simulation
==================

Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see
:doc:`using-quickstart`.


.. include:: ../reuse/note-stochastic.txt


A. Baseline outbreak
--------------------

*Figure 1: Outbreak without vaccination campaigns* shows the complete trajectory of the outbreak
without vaccination campaigns.

  Figure 2: Outbreak without vaccination campaigns - property report



B. Vaccinations for all individuals
-----------------------------------

With three campaigns randomly administered, the fraction of immune people is above the herd immunity
(in this case, close to 80%), therefore, an outbreak will not start.

.. figure:: ..//images/generic-tutorials/Generic_SIR_IP_output_vaccination_all_property.png

  Figure 4:  Outbreak with vaccination campaigns - property report


C. Vaccination campaigns for targeted groups
--------------------------------------------

With three campaigns administered only to the easily accessible group, the fraction of immune people
is never above the group size (70%). If there is an outbreak, the group will not reach the herd
immunity no matter how many vaccine campaigns are done.

Exploring the model
===================

Starting with the campaign.json file in scenario B, change one of the single vaccination
intervention by varying the vaccination coverage and observe the herd immunity.
