====================================
Generic 3: SIER - Incubation periods
====================================

This tutorial assumes that you have read :doc:`generic-tutorial1SIR` and :doc:`generic-tutorial2SIR`.

The :term:`SIR model` in :doc:`generic-tutorial1SIR` has several limitations that might not be true
for some diseases. Many diseases have a latent phase during which the individual is infected but not
yet infectious. This delay between the acquisition of infection and the infectious state can be
incorporated within the existing model by adding a latent/exposed population, E, and letting
infected (but not yet infectious) individuals move from S to E and from E to I. If :math:`sigma` is the rate of
latent individuals becoming infectious (average duration of latency is 1/:math:`sigma`), the SEIR model becomes:

.. math::

        \begin{aligned}
        \frac{dS}{dt} & = -\frac{\beta SI}{N}\\
        \frac{dE}{dt} & = \frac{\beta SI}{N} - \sigma E\\
        \frac{dI}{dt} & = \sigma E - \gamma I\\
        \frac{dR}{dt} & = \gamma I
        \end{aligned}


with :math:`N = S + E + I + R`

Since the latency delays the start of the individual's infectious period, the secondary spread from
an infected individual will occur at a later time compared with an SIR model which has no latency.
Therefore, including a longer latency period will result in slower initial growth of the outbreak.
However, since the model does not include mortality, the basic :term:`reproductive number`,
R\ :SUB:`0`\  = :math:`\beta/\gamma`, does not change.



Demographics inputs
===================

This tutorial uses generic_scenarios_demographics file for demographics input, as do all of the
generic simulation scenarios except for :doc:`generic-tutorial2SIR`, and
:doc:`generic-tutorial-10Zoonosis`. You can view the complete demographics file at <path_to_directory>\Scenarios\InputFiles
where <path_to_directory> is the location where you installed the |quick|. For more information on
demographics files, see :doc:`parameter-demographics`.



Key configuration parameters
============================

This tutorial uses the config.json in <path_to_directory>\Scenarios\Generic Scenarios\03_SEIR
directory.


Demographics parameters
-----------------------

Set **Enable_Vital_Dyanamics** to 0.  This will disable vital dynamics (birth and death) in the simulation.
For more information, see :ref:`config-demographics` parameters.


SEIR model setup parameters
---------------------------

The incubation period, infection period, and immunity must be enabled for an :term:`SEIR model`. Immunity
waning must be disabled. For more information, see :ref:`config-generaldisease` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Base_Incubation_Period** to 8.

  * Set **Enable_Immunity** to 1.

  * Set **Enable_Immune_Decay** to 0.

  * Set **Incubation_Period_Distribution** to "EXPONENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION."



Disease parameters
------------------

In the following example, we still use the same parameters as in the SIR model: the average
infectious duration is 4 days; and R\ :SUB:`0`\  = 14 (measles-like). However, this time we will add
a latent period of 8 days. For more information, see :ref:`config-generaldisease` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Base_Infectivity** to 3.5.

  * Set **Base_Infectious_Period** to 4.

  * Set **Infectious_Period_Distribution** to "EXPONENTIAL_DURATION."



Time step and duration parameters
---------------------------------

For more information, see :ref:`config-simulationsetup` parameters. Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Simulation_Timestep** to 1.

  * Set **Simulation_Duration** to 90.


Interventions
=============

This tutorial uses the campaign.json file in the
<path_to_directory>\Scenarios\Generic Scenarios\03_SEIR directory.


Initial outbreak
----------------

This simulation uses an **OutbreakIndividual** event at day 1 to create the initial seeding.
For more information, see :ref:`iv-outbreakindividual` parameters.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/generic3-interventions1.json
  :language: JSON


Run the simulation
==================

Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see
:doc:`using-quickstart`.


.. include:: ../reuse/note-stochastic.txt

Simulation output graphs
------------------------

The complete course of outbreak is observed. After the initial fast growth, the epidemic depletes
the susceptible population. Eventually the virus cannot find enough new susceptible people and dies
out.

Although R\ :SUB:`0`\ and the cumulative number of infected individuals does not change, including
latency slows down the growth of the epidemic.

Exploring the model
===================

Change the latent period to observe the initial growth. The following figure shows the results of
changing to a shorter latent period (2 days).
