|HINT_s| 5: Seattle commuting
=============================

This tutorial simulates the person-person disease transmission of influenza in Seattle over the
course of one year. The tutorial assumes that individuals have round-trip travels, or commutes,
between census tracts in less than one day. The return time is less than or equal to 8 hours and
movement is in equilibrium. Different from homogeneous mixing, the heterogeneous movement links and
rates between census tracts will create a timing difference of epidemic trajectories upon initial
seeding.

The tutorial represents Seattle as a single node. There are 125 groups based on Seattle census tract
data. The heterogeneous infectivity between individuals and the 125 groups is represented by a WAIFW
matrix with :math:`\beta` values. The values, which represent the heterogeneous force of
infection at each census tract, are based on the movement rate between census tracts and the return
rate. Individuals interact mostly with other individuals in their own census tract but also shed
into or acquire infection from the census tracts that they commuted to during the day.

Demographics inputs
===================

To view the complete demographics file, see hint_seattlecommuting_demographics at
<path_to_directory>\Scenarios\InputFiles where <path_to_directory> is the location where the |quick|
was installed. For more information, see :doc:`parameter-demographics`.


Generating Seattle as a single node
===================================

The hint_seattlecommuting_demographics file was generated from the multi-node
Seattle_30arcsec_demographics file, the Seattle_30arcsec_local_migration file, and the
Seattle_30arcsec_regional_migration file using the Python script
ConvertMultipleNodeDemographicsToSingleNodePools. The script also added the **IndividualProperties**
attribute that is needed for this tutorial.

The ConvertMultipleNodeDemographicsToSingleNodePools Python file, Seattle_Template, which is a copy
of the hint_seattlecommuting_demographics file, and the three multi-node input files are in the
Scenarios\HINT\05_SeattleCommuting\script directory.



IndividualProperties
--------------------

For more information, see :ref:`demo-individualproperties` parameters.

Property and Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Property** and **Values** parameters of **IndividualProperties** define 125 groups based on Seattle
census tracts. The **Property** type must be "Geographic" as it is the only property that supports 125
**Values**. The **Values** are the 3-digit ID for the 125 Seattle census tracts for Seattle.


Initial_Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Initial_Distribution** is an array with 125 elements. See the hint_seattlecommuting_demographics
file for those values.


Transitions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Individuals will not move from one Seattle census track to the other so **Transitions** is empty.


TransmissionMatrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**TransmissionMatrix** contains the :math:`\beta` values that scale the base infectivity. The transmission **Route**
is "Contact". The :math:`\beta` values are added to **Matrix**.

The **Matrix** was created using a script with a specified return rate. The script loads the existing
multi-node demographics and migration input files, and converts them to a single-node demographics
file. Each component in the **TransmissionMatrix** is calculated based on the spatial coupling of round-
trip movement flow detailed in the article: Balcan, D., Colizza, V., Gonçalves, B., et al. (2009).
Multiscale mobility networks and the spatial spreading of infectious diseases. PNAS 106(51),
21484-21489. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0906910106.

Since the average hours to stay at a destination is 8 hours (1/3 of a day) and the return rate is
the inverse of the average hours, the return rate is 3. That is, :math:`\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{3})}=3`.

There are 125 Seattle census tracts so the **Matrix** is a 125 x 125 matrix.

See the hint_seattlecommuting_demographics file in the Scenario\InputFiles directory to see
the complete **IndividualProperties** for this simulation.

Key configuration parameters
============================

The generic disease model parameters are configured to approximate the dynamics of influenza-like-
illness disease. The key influenza disease parameters are listed below. For more information,
see :ref:`config-generaldisease` parameters.

You can see the complete config.json file in the Scenarios\HINT\05_SeattleCommuting directory.


Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Base_Infectivity** to 0.3.

  * Set **Base_Infectious_Period** to 7.

  * Set **Base_Incubation_Period** to 3.

  * Set **Enable_Heterogeneous_Intranode_Transmission** to 1.

  * Set **Incubation_Period_Distribution** to "FIXED_DURATION."

  * Set **Infectious_Period_Distribution** to "FIXED_DURATION."



Interventions
=============

This simulation uses an **OutbreakIndividual** event to demonstrate the ability to target an outbreak at
a geographical region represented as a heterogeneous group. The **OutbreakIndividual** targets the
infection at 1% of the individuals living in census tract 7 at day 20. For more information,
see :ref:`iv-outbreakindividual` parameters.

You can see the complete campaign.json file in the in the Scenarios\HINT\05_SeattleCommuting
directory.

Run the simulation
==================

Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see
:doc:`using-quickstart`.


.. include:: ../reuse/note-stochastic.txt


Expected simulation output
--------------------------

This tutorial shows the timing difference of disease spread between groups due to spatial coupling.
It has 125 groups that represent the census tracts in Seattle and simulates a daily commute between
the census tracts.

The following Inset Charts shows the daily number of infected people for each census tract in the
simulation sorted by census tract ID. The census tracts are sequentially ordered with the census
tract with the lowest number at the top of the graph. the graph shows the difference in timing
between census tracts in terms of the disease spread.

Exploring the model
===================

Change the return rates to either increase or decrease the spatial coupling when generating the
demographic input and transmission matrix. In general, when the return rates are high, there is less
coupling between census tracts so the disease curves of the outbreak are less synchronized. The
following example shows a less synchronized behavior of disease spread when the return rate = 24
(people spend 1 hour on average at their destination) with the outbreak targeted at "Geographic: 7" in
the demographics file.



Updating a demographics file
----------------------------

You can manually modify the the Seattle_template provided in the
Scenarios\HINT\05_SeattleCommuting\script directory. However, because of the size of the
TransmissionMatrix, you might want to use the Python scripts (also in
Scenarios\HINT\05_SeattleCommuting\script) to modify the Seattle_template and regenerate the
demographics file. Update the value of returnRate in
ConvertMultipleNodeDemographicsToSingleNodePools using an editor of your choice.


.. note::

   All of the multi-node demographics files and Seattle_template must be in the same directory.

For example, the following Inset Chart graph shows decreased spatial coupling after modifying the
demographics file.
