Each scenario has a corresponding directory and a demographics file in the ScenariosInputFiles directory so you can run the simulation on your computer. All of these configuration files (config.json) have Simulation_Type set to GENERIC_SIM. There are two ways to use the tutorials. You can read the tutorials information and graphs to learn about the model; installing the Quick Start is not required. Or, for a more hands-on approach, you can also run the simulations that are associated with the tutorials and make the suggested changes to the configuration files to see the impact on the output graphs. The EMOD executable and all of the files needed to run the simulations are included in the Quick Start installation. You can refer to EMOD parameter reference for more information regarding individual parameters that you are interested in modifying. Note These scenarios are for learning purposes only and are not considered scientifically valid.

They are of particular interest because typically a zoonosis disease has previously not been in the population, and the whole population is susceptible. This tutorial demonstrates an animal reservoir, independently of human infections, reintroducing zoonotic cases at a specified rate. This tutorial is important because for many zoonotic diseases, there is a background animal reservoir that continuously exposes humans to infection. In these situations, the interest is not only in a single large outbreak which can be simulated by an Outbreak event, but also in the population-level dynamics where there is a continuous background rate of introducing a new zoonotic infection to the human population which can be configured by parameter Zoonosis_Rate . In this tutorial, the rate of infection from the animal reservoir can be adjusted with respect to the human-to-human infectiousness to vary along a spectrum, from a low rate of primary zoonotic infection with substantial secondary human transmission to a high zoonosis rate with low human transmission. This shifts the fraction of cases that are primary zoonotic infections. By varying the parameter Zoonosis_Rate , you can observe the daily rate of zoonotic infection per individual and the impact of the parameter changes on the outbreak. Input files \u00b6 The input files for this tutorial differ from the previous tutorials. The previous tutorials were simple single-node simulations without migration. This tutorial uses Seattle as an example of a multi-node simulation with migration rates. The input files include not a only a human population demographics file but also a zoonosis demographics file and local and regional migration files. Seattle_30arcsec_demographics_zoonosis Seattle_Seattle_30arcsec_local_migration Seattle_Seattle_30arcsec_regional_migration You can view these files at <path_to_directory>ScenariosInputFiles where <path_to_directory> is the location where the Quick Start was installed. For more information on data input files, see Input data files . Key configuration parameters \u00b6 This tutorial uses the config.json file in the <path_to_directory>ScenariosGeneric10_Zoonosis directory. Input file parameters \u00b6 This tutorial uses two demographics files. The first demographics file provides information about the people in the region while the second provides information on zoonosis. Multiple demographics file are listed under one parameter. When there is more than one demographics file, the file names are separated by a semi-colon. This is a multi-node simulation that also supports migration between the nodes. This simulation supports only local and regional migration. The input files for the different types of migration are specified with different parameters. The following parameters specify the demographic and migration input files. For more information, see Input files parameters. Set the following parameters: Set Demographics_Filename to \u201cSeattle_30arcsec_demographics.json;Seattle_30arcsec_demographics_zoonosis.json.\u201d Set Local_Migration__Filename to \u201cSeattle_30arcsec_local_migration.bin.\u201d Set Regional_Migration_Filename to \u201cSeattle_30arcsec_regional_migration.bin.\u201d Demographics parameters \u00b6 The following parameters enable vital dynamics for birth but disable non-disease related death and disease related deaths. For more information, see Demographics parameters. Set the following parameters: Set Enable_Vital_Dynamics to 1. Set Enable_Birth to 1. Set Death_Rate_Dependence to \u201cNONDISEASE_MORTALITY_BY_AGE_AND_GENDER.\u201d Set Enable_Disease_Mortality to 0. Migration input file parameters \u00b6 The following parameters enable or disable the specific type of migration. For more information, see Migration parameters. Set the following parameters: Set Enable_Air_Migration to 0. Set Enable_Local_Migration to 1. Set Enable_Regional_Migration to 1. Set Enable_Sea_Migration to 0. SEIRS model setup parameters \u00b6 This tutorial uses an SEIRS model . The following parameters configure the EMOD executable to run an SEIRS-like disease model with person-to-person direct transmission. For more information, see General disease parameters. Set the following parameters: Set Base_Incubation_Period to 3. Set Incubation_Period_Distribution to \u201cFIXED_DURATION.\u201d Set Enable_Immunity to 1. Set Enable_Immune_Decay to 1. Migration parameters \u00b6 In a multi-node simulation with migration enabled, individuals have a probably of \u201cmigrating\u201d to another node at every time step unless they have already migrated. When an individual has migrated to another node, they can shed or acquire infection in that node. The migration pattern for this simulation is configured as \u201cWAYPOINTS_HOME\u201d with Roundtrip_Waypoints set to 1. This means, individuals \u201cmigrate\u201d one day and return home the next day. There are no intermediate nodes between the home and the destination node. For more information, see Migration parameters. Set the following parameters: Set Migration_Model to \u201cFIXED_RATE_MIGRATION.\u201d Set Migration_Pattern to \u201cWAYPOINTS_HOME.\u201d Set Roundtrip_Waypoints to 1. Disease parameters \u00b6 These parameters configure the EMOD executable to run an SEIRS-like disease model with person- to- person direct transmission. For more information, see General disease parameters. Set the following parameters: Set Base_Infectivity to 0.25. Set Base_Infectious_Period to 7. Set Infectious_Period_Distribution to \u201cFIXED_DURATION.\u201d Zoonosis parameters \u00b6 The following parameters configure the animal zoonosis. The Zoonosis_Rate is multiplied with the Zoonosis rate in the demographic file. For more information, see General disease parameters. Set the following parameters: Set Animal_Reservoir_Type to \u201cZOONOSIS_FROM_DEMOGRAPHICS.\u201d Set Zoonosis_Rate to 0.005. Immunity parameters \u00b6 At the time of recovery when the infection is cleared, the values of immunity against acquisition, transmission, and mortality are multiplied by Immunity_Acquisition_Factor , Immunity_Transmission_Factor , and Immunity_Mortality_Factor parameters. The default values are set to 0 in the files, which means full and complete protection against each. For more information, see General disease parameters. In this scenario, people\u2019s immunity decays with an average half-life of 33 days and a 400-day offset. This assumption applies to transmission blocking, acquisition blocking, and mortality blocking immunity. Set the following parameters: Set Acquisition_Blocking_Immunity_Duration_Before_Decay to 400. Set Acquisition_Blocking_Immunity_Decay_Rate to 0.03. Set Transmission_Blocking_Immunity_Duration_Before_Decay to 400. Set Transmission_Blocking_Immunity_Decay_Rate to 0.03. Set Immunity_Acquisition_Factor to 0. Set Immunity_Mortality_Factor to 0. Set Immunity_Transmission_Factor to 0. Set Mortality_Blocking_Immunity_Duration_Before_Decay to 400. Set Mortality_Blocking_Immunity_Decay_Rate to 0.03. Intervention \u00b6 This simulation uses an Outbreak event for repeated infection seeding. This simulation uses the campaign.json in the <path_to_directory>ScenariosGeneric10_Zoonosis directory.

For more information, see How to run Quick Start simulations . Note Because the EMOD model is stochastic , your graphs may appear slightly different from those given below. Simulation output graphs \u00b6 After the initial outbreak, there are no additional imported cases set in the campaign file. However, because of the non-zero zoonosis rate, there are several introductions of infections in the background, as shown in the Log Prevalence chart in Figure 1. When enough susceptible individuals are accumulated due to immunity waning, one of the seeds starts a disease outbreak later due to zoonosis (see Figure 1 and Figure 2). The seeding and occasional outbreaks after the seeding is shown in the following graph plotting infections over time.

The tutorial describes the differences between the stochastic EMOD model and the deterministic SIR model and demonstrates how the Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD) is configured to simulate an SIR epidemic. After running the base simulation of the SIR epidemic, you can vary the parameters for disease infectivity and infection duration to see the effect on the height of the epidemic peak, the time to reach the peak, and the cumulative number of disease cases. The SIR model \u00b6 The simplest way to model epidemic spread in populations is to classify people into different population groups or compartments. One of the classic but still widely used models divides people into three groups: S - susceptible, I - infected/infectious, and R - recovered/immune. This model was first used by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 and has subsequently been applied to a variety of diseases, especially airborne childhood diseases with life-long immunity upon recovery, such as measles, mumps, rubella, and pertussis. S, I and R represent the number of susceptible,infected, and recovered individuals, and N = S + I + R is the total population. The infectious rate \u03b2 controls the rate of spread which represents the probability of transmitting disease between a susceptible and an infectious individual. Recovery rate, \u03b3 = 1/D, is determined by the average duration, D, of infection. If the course of the infection is short (emergent outbreak) compared with the life time of an individual, and the disease is non-fatal, vital dynamics (birth and death) can be ignored. In the deterministic form, the SIR model can be written as follows: It is challenging to derive exact analytical solutions of the previous equations because of the non- linear dynamics. However, the key metrics that control the spread can be derived. At the initial seeding of the infection, the following condition needs to be satisfied for a disease to spread: If the number of infections at the initial stage is small and the initial R = 0 then S is close to N and the condition becomes: where \u03b2/\u03b3 is named the reproductive number (R 0 ). R 0 is the average number of secondary cases generated by an index case in a fully susceptible population. The disease will spread in the population when R 0 > 1 and will die out if R 0 < 1. SIR and EMOD model comparison \u00b6 The EMOD model is a discrete and stochastic version of the SIR model with state changes occurring at fixed time steps and an exponentially distributed duration of infection. The discrete form of the previous equation at each time step from to can be written as: The infection and recovery process can be represented as probabilistic binomial draws where: The total rate of contagion shedding from all infected individuals (the force of infection): The probability of infection: Probability of recovery: Therefore, Because the EMOD model is stochastic and discrete, the accuracy of the result will depend on \u03b4 which is set with the parameter Simulation_Timestep . By default, \u03b4 = 1 which is a day but you can choose a smaller time step in order to get more accurate results. One of the key the differences between stochastic and deterministic systems is the value of R 0 . A ordinary differential equation (ODE) model will never predict an outbreak when R 0 < 1, especially when R 0 is close to 1. In stochastic simulations it is possible to see outbreaks. For more information on the mathematics of the EMOD model, see Heterogeneity and transmission scaling in the generic documentation set. Demographic inputs \u00b6 The demographic file generic_scenarios_demographics, defines a single node with 10,000 individuals and has a fixed birth and death rate at 20 per 1000 individual per year (0.0000548 per day). This demographics file is used by this tutorial and several of the other Generic simulation tutorials. { \"NodeID\" : 1 , \"NodeAttributes\" : { \"InitialPopulation\" : 10000 , \"BirthRate\" : 0.0000548 }, \"IndividualAttributes\" : { \"MortalityDistribution\" : { \"NumDistributionAxes\" : 2 , \"AxisNames\" : [ \"gender\" , \"age\" ], \"AxisUnits\" : [ \"male=0,female=1\" , \"years\" ], \"AxisScaleFactors\" : [ 1 , 365 ], \"NumPopulationGroups\" : [ 2 , 1 ], \"PopulationGroups\" : [ [ 0 , 1 ], [ 0 ] ], \"ResultUnits\" : \"deaths per day\" , \"ResultScaleFactor\" : 1 , \"ResultValues\" : [ [ 0.0000548 ], [ 0.0000548 ] ] } } } For some of the Generic tutorials that use generic_scenarios_demographics , including this tutorial, the birth and death rate needs to be 0. In this case, the birth and death process is disabled in the configuration file (config.json) by setting the parameter Enable_Vital_Dynamics to 0. You can view the demographics file at <path_to_directory>ScenariosInputFiles where <path_to_directory> is the location where either the Quick Start was installed. For more information on demographics files, see Input data files . Key configuration parameters \u00b6 You can view the complete config.json at <path_to_directory>ScenariosGeneric Scenarios01_SIR directory. Demographics parameters \u00b6 Set Enable_Vital_Dyanamics to 0. This will disable vital dynamics (birth and death) in the simulation. SIR model setup parameters \u00b6 The EMOD generic simulation uses an SEIR-like disease model by default. You can modify the default SEIR model to an SIR model by turning off the incubation period and immune decay in the config.json file. For more information, see General disease parameters. Set the following parameters: Set Siumulation_Type to \u201cGENERIC SIM.\u201d Set Base_Incubation_Period to 0. Set Incubation_Period_Distribution to \u201cFIXED_DURATION.\u201d Set Enable_Immune_Decay to 0. Disease parameters \u00b6 As demonstrated above, the spread of disease in the SIR model depends on the basic reproductive number R 0 =\u03b2/\u03b3 . In this simulation, the average infection duration is 4 days, and R 0 =14 (measles-like). An exponentially distributed period is used to match the behavior of ODE. For more information, see General disease parameters. Set the following parameters: Set Base_Infectivity to 3.5. Set Base_Infectious_Period to 4. Set Infectious_Period_Distribution to \u201cEXPONENTIAL_DURATION.\u201d Simulation duration parameters \u00b6 The simulation is run for 3 months with a 1-day time step. For more information, see Simulation setup parameters. Set the following parameters: Set Simulation_Timestep to 1. Set Simulation_Duration to 90. Interventions \u00b6 You can define interventions and events for a simulation through a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted campaign file, typically called campaign.json. Interventions can have either a positive effect on a simulation (for example, a vaccination campaign) or a negative impact (for example, an outbreak). For this simulation, the intervention is an outbreak. Initial outbreak \u00b6 This simulation uses an OutbreakIndividual event at day 1 as the initial seeding of the infection. For more information, see OutbreakIndividual parameters. { \"Use_Defaults\" : 1 , \"Campaign_Name\" : \"Initial Seeding\" , \"Events\" : [{ \"Event_Coordinator_Config\" : { \"Intervention_Config\" : { \"Antigen\" : 0 , \"Genome\" : 0 , \"Outbreak_Source\" : \"PrevalenceIncrease\" , \"class\" : \"OutbreakIndividual\" }, \"Target_Demographic\" : \"Everyone\" , \"Demographic_Coverage\" : 0.0005 , \"class\" : \"StandardInterventionDistributionEventCoordinator\" }, \"Event_Name\" : \"Outbreak\" , \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"class\" : \"NodeSetAll\" }, \"Start_Day\" : 1 , \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" }] } You can view the complete campaign.json in <path_to_directory>ScenariosGeneric Scenarios01_SIR directory. Run the simulation \u00b6 Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see How to run Quick Start simulations . Note Because the EMOD model is stochastic , your graphs may appear slightly different from those given below. Simulation output graphs \u00b6 Figure 1: growth of infection and depletion of the susceptible population is a graph of the complete course of the outbreak. After the initial fast growth, the epidemic depletes the susceptible population. Eventually the virus cannot find enough new susceptible people and dies out. Figure 1: Growth of infection and depletion of the susceptible population Figure 2: All inset charts Exploring the model \u00b6 The EMOD model is individual-based, which allows the implementation of a flexible distribution. In an ODE model the time constants are exponentially distributed, however, this is not case for some diseases. You can test the effects of different distributions in the EMOD executable by changing Infectious_Period_Distribution in the configuration file. Set the value of Infectious_Period_Distribution to \u201cFIXED_DURATION\u201d and let all other parameters remain the same. The following output shows a much faster spread of disease when using a fixed duration for the infection period. Figure 3: Infectious_Period_Distribution is FIXED_DURATION You can also try the same SIR model with different basic reproductive number values. For example, run the simulation with R 0 equal to 0.2 and 2.0. Simulation with R 0 =0.2 : Keep Base_Infectious_Period equal to 4 and change Base_Infectivity to 0.05. Simulation with R 0 =2.0 : Keep Base_Infectious_Period equal to 4 and change Base_Infectivity to 0.5. The following images shows the simulation results with R 0 equal to 0.2 and 2.0. Figure 4: R 0 =0.2 - No Outbreak ( Base_Infectivity = 0.05) Figure 5: R 0 =2.0 - Outbreak ( Base_Infectivity = 0.5)", "tags": "", "title": "Generic 1: SIR - Simple single-node outbreak \u2014 Training Tutorials  documentation"}, {"url": "./generic-tutorial2SIR.html", "text": "Generic 2: SIR - Targeted vaccination campaigns \u00b6 This tutorial assumes that you have read Generic 1: SIR - Simple single-node outbreak . This tutorial implements vaccination strategies to control an SIR epidemic in a single-node, village-scale location. The tutorial demonstrates how to configure vaccination interventions and the effect of those vaccine interventions on herd immunity. The tutorial also demonstrates how to target vaccines to heterogeneous groups within the node. By default, the EMOD executable assumes every individual has the same probability of being selected for vaccination. However, it is possible to model certain groups with low or no vaccination coverage through the use of IndividualProperties . IndividualProperties is added to the demographics file and configured to create the groups. For more information see IndividualProperties. This tutorial consists of three scenarios: Baseline outbreak Vaccination campaigns all individuals Vaccination campaigns targeted groups Vaccination and herd immunity \u00b6 In Generic 1: SIR - Simple single-node outbreak , the SIR model assumed all individuals are susceptible before the importation of an outbreak. However, vaccination is the one of the most effective ways to prevent or contain a disease outbreak. This scenario demonstrates the effect of vaccinations. Starting from the SIR equations discussed in the previous tutorials: For an outbreak to start, the following condition needs to be satisfied: If a vaccination campaign with coverage p [0, 1] is performed before the outbreak, only a fraction of susceptible people move to the recovered compartment. If the vaccine take is e [0, 1], representing the probability of being protected after receiving a vaccine dose, the fraction of immune people due to vaccination is ep . Therefore, the previous condition can be reduced to: R eff is also called the effective reproductive number. Vaccination can reduce the disease\u2019s ability to spread, and the outbreak can be prevented or stopped with less than 100% coverage. When R eff = 1, there exists a minimum vaccination coverage that can prevent a disease outbreak. This minimum coverage required to prevent an outbreak is usually called herd immunity (represented as P herd ). Therefore, the analytical form of P herd can be derived based on the previous condition: Multiple rounds of vaccinations \u00b6 If multiple vaccine interventions are performed in the same area, people are selected on a binomial basis and all individuals have the same probability of being included. If the vaccine coverage is p, every individual has a probability p of being selected in a given round. After the first round, the fraction of non-vaccinated is 1- p , and after n rounds this fraction is (1 - p) n . Therefore, the fraction of people getting at least 1 dose is: For example, the fraction of people getting at least one vaccination with a 50% campaign coverage is shown in the following table. After a few rounds, the coverage increases significantly with the number of campaigns. Scenario B demonstrates this example. Number of Campaigns Covered Fraction (>=1 dose) 1 50% 2 75% 3 87.5% 4 93.75% 5 96.875% However, this is usually not the case. In recent polio eradication campaigns, the number of supplemental immunization activity (SIA) campaigns planned in certain high-risk districts is greater than 6 per year, but poliovirus still persists in the area due to certain groups that are chronically missed. This can be caused by low accessibility, exclusion from SIA microplans, or vaccine refusal. R eff has not been driven below 1 because these susceptible people in the chronically missed groups are still in contact with the rest of population. In some modeling simulations, this assumption has to be included. In this second example, the same 50% campaign coverage is repeated so that the same amount of vaccine is used. However, 30% of the population is not accessible to any vaccine campaigns. Although the number of vaccine doses used is the same as the previous example, the overall coverage is much less. The scenario C demonstrates this example. Number of Campaigns Covered Fraction of Total Population Covered Fraction of Groups with Access Covered Fraction of Groups without Access 1 50% 71.43% 0% 2 29% 91.84% 0% 3 68.37% 97.67% 0% 4 69.53% 99.33% 0% 5 69.87% 99.81% 0% Demographics inputs \u00b6 This simulation uses the demographics file \u201cgeneric_scenarios_individualproperties_demographics\u201d. Except for an IndividualProperties structure, the demographics file is the same as \u201cgeneric_scenarios_demographics\u201d used in Generic 1: SIR - Simple single-node outbreak . Individual Properties \u00b6 An IndividualProperties structure is added to Defaults in the demographics file. Its purpose for this scenario is to divide individuals into two groups so the individuals in different groups can be configured differently. In the third scenario, a vaccine campaign will be targeted at only one of the groups but not the other group. This models the situation where individuals in the general population have a chance of receiving a vaccine while the other individuals are in the chronically missed group. { \"Metadata\" : { }, \"Defaults\" : { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"Property\" : \"Accessibility\" , \"Values\" : [ \"Easy\" , \"Hard\" ], \"Initial_Distribution\" : [ 0.7 , 0.3 ], \"Transitions\" : [] }] }, \"Nodes\" : [{ }] } Property and values \u00b6 The IndividualProperties structure creates groups using the Property and Values parameters. The Property parameter specifies the property type. This tutorial uses the property type Accessibility . The Values array defines the groups. Each element in the array is a group. In this tutorial, the groups are \u201cEasy\u201d and \u201cHard\u201d. They represent the group that is easy to access during a vaccine campaign (Easy), and the chronically missed group (Hard). Note Property and Values creates the groups. However, the different behavior of the two groups must be configured with parameters in the campaign files. Initial_Distribution \u00b6 At the beginning of the simulation individuals are assigned a group using the probabilities in the Initial_Distribution array. The values in the Initial_Distribution array must be in the same order as the groups in the Values array. At the beginning of the simulation, each individual has a 70% of belonging to the \u201cEasy\u201d accessibility group and a 30% chance of belonging to the \u201cHard\u201d accessibility group as specified by the Initial_Distribution array. { \"Defaults\" : { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"Property\" : \"Accessibility\" , \"Values\" : [ \"Easy\" , \"Hard\" ], \"Initial_Distribution\" : [ 0.7 , 0.3 ], \"Transitions\" : [] }] } } Note Transitions is not used in this tutorial but it must be include as an empty array. When the simulation is run, it will create an empty Transitions output file which can be ignored. Note that this tutorial only uses IndividualProperties to divide the population into groups. In more complex simulations, IndividualProperties can be used to differentiate the disease transmission between multiple groups within a node. This is described in Heterogeneous Intra-Node Transmission (HINT) tutorials . Key configuration parameters \u00b6 All three of the scenarios in this tutorial use the same simulation set up. Please note each subdirectory has a copy of the config.json file. You can view the complete config.json in the following directories: <path_to_directory>ScenariosGeneric Scenarios02_SIR_VaccinationsA_BaselineOutbreak <path_to_directory>ScenariosGeneric Scenarios02_SIR_VaccinationsB_VaccinationAll <path_to_directory>ScenariosGeneric Scenarios02_SIR_VaccinationsC_TargetedVaccination Demographics parameters \u00b6 Set Enable_Vital_Dyanamics to 0. This will disable vital dynamics (birth and death) in the simulation. For more information, see Demographics parameters.

Many diseases have a latent phase during which the individual is infected but not yet infectious. This delay between the acquisition of infection and the infectious state can be incorporated within the existing model by adding a latent/exposed population, E, and letting infected (but not yet infectious) individuals move from S to E and from E to I. If is the rate of latent individuals becoming infectious (average duration of latency is 1/ ), the SEIR model becomes: with Since the latency delays the start of the individual\u2019s infectious period, the secondary spread from an infected individual will occur at a later time compared with an SIR model which has no latency.

For another class of airborne diseases, for example seasonal influenza, an individual\u2019s immunity may wane over time. In this case, the SIRS model is used allow recovered individuals return to a susceptible state.

Similar to the SIRS model , the infected individuals return to the susceptible state. This model is appropriate for diseases that commonly have repeat infections, for example, the common cold (rhinoviruses), or sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea or chlamydia. For this model, we can analytically solve the ordinary differential equation (ODE) to understand the dynamics. For simplicity, the following ODE model ignores the vital process (birth and death): At equilibrium, solving: There are two equilibrium states for the SIS model, the first is (disease free state), and the second is: For disease to spread, we need to have . Therefore, similar to the previously described concept of the basic reproductive number , when , the disease will spread and approach the second steady state; otherwise, it will eventually reach the disease-free state.

By default, the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) uses frequency-dependent transmission and the overall transmissibility does not change with population size or density. An infected individual will infect the same number of people either in a small village or in a metropolitan area. However, it is possible when population size is low, the transmissibility might be less and follow density- dependent behavior instead of frequency-dependent behavior. Based on existing evidence, it is possible that neither a frequency-dependent nor a density- dependent mechanism may adequately describe the correct scaling over the entire population density spectrum. The EMOD executable uses the spatial contact model with constant population density and limited activity range to estimate contact rates as discussed in the article The scaling of contact rates with population density for the infectious disease models , by Hu et al ., 2013 Journal of Mathematical Bioscience . 244(2):125-134. The scaling function can be specified for \u03b2, in the form of: \u03b2 = \u03b2 0 (1- e \u03c1/\u03c1 c50 ) where \u03c1 c50 is a constant determining the speed of increase of infectivity. For this tutorial, the simulation is run three times with a different node size for each run. The change of node grid size will result in the change of population density for the simulations.

Simulation output graphs \u00b6 The simulation was run three times with the Node_Grid_Size set to three different values: 0.1, 0.15, and 0.3 degrees. The node was assumed to be near the equator (both latitude and longitude were set to 0) and the population was 10,000. Using the three different Node_Grid_Size values, the node area for the three simulations were 124, 278, and 1112 km 2 , respectively. With a population of 10,000, the population density was 80, 36, and 9 people/km 2 , respectively. Using the data described in the previous paragraph, the three densities correspond to different R:sub:0values: close to 1.5, close to 1, and well below 1, respectively, as shown in the following graph from Hu *et al*., 2013. *Journal of Mathematical Bioscience*. 244(2):125-134. .

Contents Software terms Epidemiology terms Malaria and vector terms Software terms \u00b6 The following terms are used to describe both general computing processes and concepts and the files, features, and functionality related to running simulations with Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD). agent-based model A type of simulation that models the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual and collective entities such as organizations or groups). Boost Free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source libraries aimed at a wide range of uses including parallel processing applications (Boost.MPI). For more information, please see the Boost website, http://www.boost.org . campaign A collection of events that use interventions to modify a simulation . campaign event A JSON object that determines when and where an intervention is distributed during a campaign. campaign file A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted file that contains the parameters that specify the distribution instructions for all interventions used in a campaign, such as diagnostic tests, the target demographic, and the timing and cost of interventions. The location of this file is specified in the configuration file with the Campaign_Filename parameter. Typically, the file name is campaign.json. channel A property of the simulation (for example, \u201cParasite Prevalence\u201d) that is accumulated once per simulated time step and written to file, typically as an array of the accumulated values. class factory A function that instantiate objects at run-time and use information from JSON-based configuration information in the creation of these objects. configuration file A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted file that contains the parameters sufficient for initiating a simulation. It controls many different aspects of the simulation, such as population size, disease dynamics, and length of the simulation. Typically, the file name is config.json. core In computing, a core refers to an independent central processing unit (CPU) in the computer. Multi-core computers have more than one CPU. However, through technologies such as Hyper- Threading Technology (HTT or HT), a single physical core can actually act like two virtual or logical cores, and appear to the operating system as two processors. demographics file A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted file that contains the parameters that specify the demographics of a population, such as age distribution, risk, birthrate, and more. IDM provides demographics files for many geographic regions. This file is considered part of the input data files and is typically named <region>_demographics.json. disease-specific build A build of the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) built using SCons without any dynamic link libraries (DLLs). dynamic link library (DLL) Microsoft\u2019s implementation of a shared library, separate from the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe), that can be dynamically loaded (and unloaded when unneeded) at runtime. This loading can be explicit or implicit. EMODule A modular component of EMOD that are consumed and used by the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe). Under Windows, a EMODule is implemented as a dynamic link library (DLL) and, under CentOS on Azure, EMODules are currently not supported. EMODules are primarily custom reporters. Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD) The modeling software from the Institute for Disease Modeling (IDM) for disease researchers and developers to investigate disease dynamics, and to assist in combating a host of infectious diseases. You may see this referred to as Disease Transmission Kernel (DTK) in the source code. Eradication.exe Typical (default) name for the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe), whether built using monolithic build or modular (EMODule-enabled) build. event coordinator A JSON object that determines who will receive a particular intervention during a campaign. flattened file A single campaign or configuration file created by combining a default file with one or more overlay files. Multiple files must be flattened prior to running a simulation. Configuration files are flattened to a single-depth JSON file without nesting, the format required for consumption by the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe). Separating the parameters into multiple files is primarily used for testing and experimentation. Heterogeneous Intra-Node Transmission (HINT) A feature for modeling person-to-person transmission of diseases in heterogeneous population segments within a node for generic simulations. high-performance computing (HPC) The use of parallel processing for running advanced applications efficiently, reliably, and quickly. input data files Fixed information used as input to a simulation. Examples of such data are population, altitude, demographics, and transportation migrations. The configurable config.json and campaign.json files do not fall into this category of static fixed input. intervention An object aimed at reducing the spread of a disease that is distributed either to an individual; such as a vaccine, drug, or bednet; or to a node; such as a larvicide. Additionally, initial disease outbreaks and intermediate interventions that schedule another intervention are implemented as interventions in the campaign file . JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) A human-readable, open standard, text-based file format for data interchange. It is typically used to represent simple data structures and associative arrays, and is language- independent. Keyhole Markup Language (KML) A file format used to display geographic data in an Earth browser, for example, Google Maps. The format uses an XML-based structure (tag-based structure with nested elements and attributes). Tags are case-sensitive. Link-Time Code Generation (LTCG) A method for the linker to optimize code (for size and/or speed) after compilation has occurred. The compiled code is turned not into actual code, but instead into an intermediate language form (IL, but not to be confused with .NET IL which has a different purpose). The LTCG then, unlike the compiler, can see the whole body of code in all object files and be able to optimize the result more effectively. Message Passing Interface (MPI) An interface used to pass information between computing cores in parallel simulations. One example is the migration of individuals from one geographic location to another within EMOD simulations. microsolver A microsolver is a type of \u201cminiature model\u201d that operates within the framework of EMOD to compute a particular set of parameters. Each microsolver, in effect, is creating a microsimulation in order to accurately capture the dynamics of that particular aspect of the model. Monte Carlo Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a class of computational algorithms utilizing repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Monte Carlo simulations create probability distributions for possible outcome values, which provides a more realistic way of describing uncertainty in variables. monolithic build A single EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) with no DLLs that includes all components as part of Eradication.exe itself. You can still use EMODules with the monolithic build; for example, a custom reporter is a common type of EMODule. View the documentation on EMODules and emodules_map.json for more information about creation and use of EMODules. node A grid size that is used for modeling geographies. Within EMOD, a node is a geographic region containing simulated individuals. Individuals migrate between nodes either temporarily or permanently using mobility patterns driven by local, regional, and long- distance transportation. node-targeted intervention An intervention that is distributed to a geographical node rather than to a single individual. One example is larvicides, which affect all mosquitoes living and feeding within a given node. output report A file that is the output from an EMOD simulation. Output reports are in JSON, CSV, or binary file format. You must pass the data from an output report to graphing software if you want to visualize the output of a simulation. overlay file An additional configuration, campaign, or demographic file that overrides the default parameter values in the primary file. Separating the parameters into multiple files is primarily used for testing a nd experimentation. In the case of configuration and campaign files, the files can use an arbitrary hierarchical structure to organize parameters into logical groups. Configuration and campaign files must be flattened into a single file before running a simulation. preview Software that undergoes a shorter testing cycle in order to make it available more quickly. Previews may contain software defects that could result in unexpected behavior. Use EMOD previews at your own discretion. regression test A test to verify that existing EMOD functionality works with new updates, typically used to refer to one of a set of scenarios included in the EMOD bundle and located in the Regression subdirectory of the bundle. Directory names of each subdirectory in Regression describe the main regression attributes, for example, \u201c1_Generic_Seattle_MultiNode\u201d. Also can refer to the process of regression testing of software. release Software that includes new functionality, scientific tutorials leveraging new or existing functionality, and/or bug fixes that have been thoroughly tested so that any defects have been fixed before release. EMOD releases undergo full regression testing. reporter Functionality that extracts simulation data, aggregates it, and saves it as an output report . EMOD provides several built-in reporters for outputting data from simulations and you also have the ability to create a custom reporter. scenario A collection of input, configuration, and campaign files that describes a real-world example of a disease outbreak and interventions. Many scenarios are included with both the Quick Start and EMOD source installations. The Quick Start documentation includes tutorials that describe how to run simulations using these scenarios to learn more about epidemiology and disease modeling. schema A text or JSON file that can be generated from the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) that defines all configuration and campaign parameters. simulation An EMOD software execution performed by the kernel. Each simulation has an associated set of files that control the inputs, configuration, and campaign. simulation type The disease or disease class to model. EMOD supports the following simulation types for modeling a variety of diseases: Generic disease (GENERIC_SIM) Vector-borne diseases (VECTOR_SIM) Malaria (MALARIA_SIM) Tuberculosis (TB_SIM) Sexually transmitted infections (STI_SIM) HIV (HIV_SIM) solvers Solvers are used to find computational solutions to problems. In simulations, they can be used, for example, to determine the time of the next simulation step, or to compute the states of a model at particular time steps. Standard Template Library (STL) A library that contains a set of common C++ classes (including generic algorithms and data structures) that are independent of container and implemented as templates, which enables compile-time polymorphism (often more efficient than run-time polymorphism). For more information and discussion of STL, see Wikipedia . state transition event A change in state (e.g. healthy to infected, undiagnosed to positive diagnosis, or birth) that may trigger a subsequent action, often an intervention. \u201cCampaign events\u201d should not be confused with state transition events. time step A discrete number of hours or days in which the \u201csimulation states\u201d of all \u201csimulation objects\u201d (interventions, infections, immune systems, or individuals) are updated in a simulation. Each time step will complete processing before launching the next one. For example, a time step would process the migration data for populations moving between nodes via rail, airline, and road. The migration of individuals between nodes is the last step of the time step after updating states. tutorial A set of instructions in the Quick Start documentation to learn more about epidemiology and disease modeling. Tutorials are based on real-world scenarios and demonstrate the mechanics of the the model. Each tutorial consists of one or more scenarios. working directory The directory that contains the configuration and campaign files for a simulation. You must be in this directory when you invoke Eradication.exe at the command line to run a simulation. Epidemiology terms \u00b6 The following terms are used to describe general concepts and processes in the field of epidemiology and disease modeling. antigen A substance that is capable of inducing a specific immune response and that evokes the production of one or more antibodies. Clausius-Clayperon relation A way of characterizing a transition between two phases of matter; provides a method to find a relationship between temperature and pressure along phase boundaries. Frequently used in meteorology and climatology to describe the behavior of water vapor. See Wikipedia - Clausius-Clayperon relation for more information. deterministic Characterized by the output being fully determined by the parameter values and the initial conditions. Given the same inputs, a deterministic model will always produce the same output. diffusive migration The diffusion of people in and out of nearby nodes by foot travel. epitope The portion of an antigen that the immune system recognizes. An epitope is also called an antigenic determinant. Euler method Used in mathematics and computational science, this method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations with a given initial value. exp( The exponential function, , where is the number (approximately 2.718281828) such that the function is its own derivative. The exponential function is used to model a relationship in which a constant change in the independent variable gives the same proportional change (i.e. percentage increase or decrease) in the dependent variable. The function is often written as . The graph of is upward-sloping and increases faster as increases. herd immunity The resistance to the spread of a contagious disease within a population that results if a sufficiently high proportion of individuals are immune to the disease, especially through vaccination. incidence The rate of new cases of a disease during a specified time period. This is a measure of the risk of contracting a disease. Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification System A system based on the concept that native vegetation is a good expression of climate. Thus, climate zone boundaries have been selected with vegetation distribution in mind. It combines average annual and monthly temperatures and precipitation, and the seasonality of precipitation. The DTK has several options for configuring the climate, namely air temperature, rainfall, and humidity. One option utilizes Input Files that associate geographic nodes with Koppen climate indices. The modified Koppen classification uses three letters to divide the world into five major climate regions (A, B, C, D, and E) based on average annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly temperature. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on temperature and precipitation. While the Koppen system does not take such things as temperature extremes, average cloud cover, number of days with sunshine, or wind into account, it is a good representation of our earth\u2019s climate. loss to follow-up (LTFU) Patients who at one point were actively participating in disease treatment or clinical research, but have become lost either by error or by becoming unreachable at the point of follow-up. ordinary differential equation (ODE) A differential equation containing one or more functions of one independent variable and its derivatives. prevalence The rate of all cases of a disease during a specified time period. This is a measure of how widespread a disease is. reproductive number In a fully susceptible population, the basic reproductive number R:sub:0is the number of new cases generated by one infectious case over the course of the infectious period. The effective reproductive number takes into account non-susceptible individuals. routine immunization (RI) The standard practice of vaccinating the majority of susceptible people in a population against vaccine-preventable diseases. scenario A real-world or hypothetical situation that demonstrates or represents disease dynamics. stochastic Characterized by having a random probability distribution that may be analyzed statistically but not predicted precisely. subpatent When an individual is infected but asymptomatic, so the infection is not readily detectable.

WAIFW matrix A matrix of values that describes the rate of transmission between different population groups. WAIFW is an abbrevation for Who Acquires Infection From Whom. Malaria and vector terms \u00b6 The following terms are used to describe the biological processes involved in malaria and other vector-borne diseases. circumsporozoite protein (CSP) One of two proteins (the other being thrombospondin-related adhesive protein) involved in sporozoite recognition of host cells in malaria. cohort model A vector model that tracks properties of mosquito \u201ccohorts\u201d, for example, population, age, gender, fertility, etc. cytokine Cytokines are small secreted proteins that are released by cells, and have specific effects on interactions and communications between cells. They are especially important in the immune system, and can function in inflammatory (and anti-inflammatory) response. CRISPR A genome-editing technique that utilizes the CRISPR/Cas9 system (a prokaryotic immune system) that can be used to splice DNA sequences in very specific target locations, enabling the precise insertion or removal of genes of interest. entomological inoculation rate (EIR) The commonly-used measure of the intensity of malaria transmission. EIR is equal to the number of mosquito bites per night times the proportion of those bites that test positive for sporozoites. gametocyte The male and female sexual forms of the blood-stage malaria parasite. During blood-feeding, gametocytes are taken up into the mosquito mid-gut where they commence the mosquito-phase of the parasite life cycle. gene drive mosquito Gene drive is a genetic technique that promotes the inheritance of particular genes or specific genetic elements. In mosquitoes, approaches are being tested that work to suppress the spread of malaria by creating mosquito lines through fertility suppression, driving-Y chromosomes, or express genes that limit malaria transmission. gonotrophic A female mosquito\u2019s feeding and egg-laying cycle, where the duration is defined as the average number of days that gravid mosquitoes take to oviposit after taking a blood meal. hepatocyte The cell type that comprises liver tissue. homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) \u201cSelfish\u201d genetic elements that can spread through the mosquito population even at a cost to the host. The HEG allele status is a tracked property of mosquitoes. Large numbers of HEG- positive mosquitoes may be introduced into the simulation by a MosquitoRelease intervention. individual mosquito model A vector model simulation where every individual mosquito in the population is modeled, as well as a simulation of a sampled subset of mosquitoes to represent the population as the whole. indoor residual spraying (IRS) The process of spraying insecticide on the interior surfaces of dwellings in order to repel or kill mosquitoes. insecticide-treated nets (ITN) Bednets hung over sleeping areas that are treated with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and kill those that land on them. larval habitat Mosquito larval ecology includes several habitat types including brackish swamp, constant, human population, temporary rainfall, and semi-permanent water vegetation. larvicide A node-targeted intervention that may be configured to have a direct killing effect on the larval population and a temporary reduction on available larval habitat. mass drug administration (MDA) The treatment of an entire population in a geographic area with a curative dose of an antimalarial drug without first testing for infection, and regardless of the presence of symptoms. merozoite The malaria parasite stage that invades red blood cells. After each cycle of asexual reproduction within the infected red blood cell, merozoites are released into the bloodstream to invade new red blood cells. merozoites see \u201cmerozoite\u201d merozoite surface protein (MSP) A type of protein integral to red blood cell invasion by malaria parasites that is an important target of the human immune response. oviposition to deposit or lay eggs. pre-erythrocytic Stages of a malaria parasite that occur before the red blood cells are invaded. This includes the period starting from inoculation with sporozoites, through the liver-stage multiplication, up to infected hepatocyte rupture, and the first invasion of erythrocytes by merozoites. pre-erythrocytic vaccine (PEV) A vaccine targeted at the earliest stage of malaria parasite development, namely before the blood-stage infection. Other vaccines target the asexual and sexual stages of the parasite. Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) A protein encoded by the malaria parasite and expressed on the surface of infected red blood cells. PfEMP1 adheres to various human receptors, allowing sequestration of parasitized red blood cells and avoidance of clearance in the spleen. PfEMP1 is an important antigenic target of the human adapted immune response. It exhibits a high degree of antigenic variation via a genetic switching mechanism evolved to escape immune pressure. schizont Cells formed during the asexual stage of the life cycle of sporozoan protozoans, such as the malaria parasite. spatial repellent An intervention that may be individually-distributed (protective indoors and outdoors), or node-distributed at the community-level, that repels mosquitoes from biting. sporogony The asexual process of spore formation in parasitic sporozoans. sporozoite a motile, spore-like stage of the malaria parasite that is the infectious agent introduced into the host. sugar-baited trap Bait stations, often placed inside houses, that have an attractive and toxic sugar used to attract and kill sugar-feeding male and female mosquitoes. superinfection The simultaneous infection with multiple strains of the same pathogen. transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV) A vaccine that blocks gametocytes from infected humans by producing viable sporozoites in mosquitoes. Also referred to as a \u201csexual-stage\u201d vaccine, since vaccines in this class block gametocytes from infected humans by producing viable sporozoites in mosquitoes. vaccine intervention types In EMOD, vaccine intervention types are either \u201cAcquisitionBlocking\u201d, \u201cTransmissionBlocking\u201d or \u201cMortalityBlocking\u201d. For example, \u201cmode-of-action\u201d, \u201ctargeted parasite stages\u201d, (such as pre-erythrocytic, asexual, or sexual), etc. vector Insect or other living carrier that transmits an infectious agent. The vector life cycle and feeding cycle in the model are described in the article Eckhoff, Malaria Journal 2011, 10:303 . vectorial capacity The daily rate of all mosquitoes that would be infected after biting a single infectious host. This measure can be used to describe the transmission intensity of malaria, and serves as a rate at which future infections arise from a currently infected host. vector model The vector model includes both a cohort model and an individual mosquito model . The model is a closed-loop feeding cycle where successful animal feeds (both indoors and outdoors) produce eggs, larva, vector mating, and then, adult mosquitoes. The vector model inherits the same human- infection model structure from the generic simulation type: uninfected, latent incubation, infectious, multiple immune variables, and superinfection. However, the transmission of infections is not between individual humans, but rather via the human-to-vector and vector- to-human pathways. Wolbachia This is a genus of bacteria that infects many arthopod species (especially insects). It has been discovered that insects infected with Wolbachia have increased resistance to viral or other parasitic infections. Work is underway to determine if strains of modified Wolbachia can be used to control malaria, by effectively preventing mosquitoes from becoming infected with Plasmodium parasites.", "tags": "", "title": "Glossary \u2014 Training Tutorials  documentation"}, {"url": "./hint-tutorial-overview.html", "text": "Heterogeneous Intra-Node Transmission (HINT) tutorials \u00b6 The Heterogeneous Intra-Node Transmission (HINT) tutorials consist of a group of scenarios that guide you through simulations that will help you understand the HINT feature, which allows you to configure heterogeneous disease transmission between different groups defined with IndividualProperties . Each tutorial has a corresponding Scenarios directory and a demographics file in the ScenariosInputFiles directory. All of these tutorials have an IndividualProperties attribute in their demographics files. An IndividualProperties attribute with a TransmissionMatrix is a requirement for a HINT simulation. Additionally, Enable_Heterogeneous_Intranode_Transmission must be set to 1 (true) in the simulation configuration file (config.json). There are two ways to use the tutorials. You can read the tutorials information and graphs to learn about the model; installing the Quick Start is not required. Or, for a more hands-on approach, you can also run the simulations that are associated with the tutorials and make the suggested changes to the configuration files to see the impact on the output graphs. The EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) and all of the files needed to run the simulations are included in the Quick Start installation.

By default, the disease transmission for a EMOD generic simulation is frequency-dependent. The expected number of secondary infections from an infected person does not change with population size.

IndividualProperties \u00b6 For HINT, IndividualProperties must be added to Defaults in the demographics file and contain a TransmissionMatrix . The TransmissionMatrix is configured with the values of the WAIFW matrix that are needed for HINT\u2018s mathematical model. Property and values \u00b6 The Property and Values parameters of IndividualProperties define two risk groups: \u201cHigh\u201d and \u201cLow\u201d. Initial_Distribution \u00b6 At the beginning of the simulation, 20% of the population is in the high-risk population and 80% are in the low-risk population as specified by the Initial_Distribution array. Transitions \u00b6 Individuals will not move from one risk group to the other so Transitions is empty. TransmissionMatrix \u00b6 In the TransmissionMatrix structure, the Matrix member is a Values x Values-sized WAIFW matrix with values that scale the base infectivity. For this simulation, the risk groups are defined in the following order: \u201cHigh\u201d and \u201cLow.\u201d The following matrix represents the direction of the disease transmission between the groups: This simulation assumes that the disease transmission within the same risk group is higher than between risk groups, and people in the high-risk group have higher transmissibility.

Expected simulation output \u00b6 The output shows the different spreading behavior of the two risk groups. The following graphs show the daily number of infected people for each group in the simulation Although the disease starts in the low risk group, the initial spread in the high-risk group is much faster because of the high transmission rates in the high-risk group, and is the main driver of the overall epidemic. Figure 1: Daily number of infected individuals by risk group Exploring the model \u00b6 Compare the HINT results with homogeneous mixing where people mix equally with each other. To do this, disable the HINT feature by setting Enable_Heterogeneous_Intranode_Transmission to 0 in the config.json file in the ScenariosHINT01_RiskGroups directory. All of the IndividualProperties will be used except for the TransmissionMatrix . Re-run the simulation and compare the following results with the previous results. You can use the sample batch file, plotPropertyReport, in the ScenariosHINT01_RiskGroups directory to generate the following graphs from the PropertyReport output file. Change the transmission rate values in the WAIFW matrix, re-run the model and see the dynamics. Make sure that the HINT feature is enabled by checking that Enable_Heterogeneous_Intranode_Transmission equals 1 in the config.json. Note It is possible that the high-low risk groups in this example are orthogonal to other factors related to transmission, for example, age or urban/rural status.

In this tutorial, a group is defined by the place where individuals go for similar activities but it is not tied to one specific geographic location.

As another example, \u201ccommunity\u201d represents places that people meet for varying activities outside of school and work, such as shopping, getting gas, or going to a movie. This tutorial also shows the effect of disease-control policies that modify group mixing during a disease outbreak (for example, the effect of closing schools during a hypothetical pandemic). Students are transitioned from the school group to another group during school closure, and reverted back to the school group when the school is reopened.

Normal activity groups: School Students who are in school. Work People who are working outside of the home. Community General activities for people who neither work nor go to school. School closure groups: SchoolBreak_Interaction Students who do activities outside of the home during a school break. SchoolBreak_NonInteraction Students who mostly stay at home during a school break.

Individuals are not assigned to SchoolBreak_Interaction and SchoolBreak_NonInteraction at the beginning of the simulation. Transitions \u00b6 Transitions is used to move individuals from one property value (group) to another. All of the individuals in \u201cSchool\u201d are moved to SchoolBreak_NonInteraction on day 20 and moved back to \u201cSchool\u201d 20 days later (day 40). SchoolBreak_Interaction is not used in this tutorial. It is added to the demographics file so that you can easily run some variations of this simulation. TransmissionMatrix \u00b6 TransmissionMatrix contains the values of the WAIFW matrix . The transmission Route is \u201cContact\u201d. The values are added to Matrix . The first three rows and columns of Matrix demonstrate a hypothetical transmission rate between the three groups: \u201cCommunity\u201d, \u201cSchool\u201d, and \u201cWork\u201d.

The scenarios simulate a measles outbreak over a single year in an initially fully susceptible population, highlighting differences in age and accessibility group-specific disease dynamics. It consists of three scenarios that illustrate the measles outbreak and targeted vaccination campaigns: A measles outbreak with no interventions. The supporting configuration and campaign files are in ScenariosHINT03_AgeAndAccessA_BaselineOutbreak. An age-targeted outreach vaccination campaign for 6 to 10 year olds. The outreach is designed to reach populations who are normally inaccessible. The supporting configuration and campaign files are in ScenariosHINT03_AgeAndAccessB_AgeTargetedVaccine. A mass measles vaccination campaign of the entire population. This is a standard campaign, not an outreach campaign, as it targets individuals who are in the accessible group of the population and easily reached by the vaccination campaign. The supporting configuration and campaign files are in ScenariosHINT03_AgeAndAccessC_AccessTargetedVaccine. Note The fully susceptible population in this tutorial is used to illustrate the model features in the most parsimonious manner. For calibration to real data, you would need to initialize a distribution of immunity in the population at the beginning of the epidemic to represent past history of infection and vaccination. This could be done through matching serology data and/or matching vaccination dose history. This tutorial assumes that you have read the previous HINT tutorial, HINT 2: School closure .

For more information, see Demographics file structure and parameters . IndividualProperties \u00b6 IndividualProperties defines two Property types: Accessibility and Age_Bin . The supporting software for Accessibility is the same as for the property types, Risk and Place , that were used in the previous tutorials. However, the Age_Bin property uses data from the demographics files for initial age distribution, and the membership in an Age_Bin group is updated as an individual ages. Therefore, the Age_Bin attribute has different structures than those of the other property types. For more information, see IndividualProperties parameters. Accessibility: Property and Values \u00b6 Property and Values define two Accessibility groups: \u201cEasy\u201d and \u201cHard\u201d. These two groups will be used to initialize the population with differential vaccination coverage. Individuals are randomly assigned one of these two values at birth and do not transition afterwards. Accessibility: Initial_Distribution \u00b6 At the beginning of the simulation, individuals have an equal chance of being assigned to either the \u201cEasy\u201d or \u201cHard\u201d group as specified in the Initial_Distribution array . Accessibility: Transitions \u00b6 Individuals will not transition from one Accessibility group to the other therefore Transitions is empty. Accessibility: TransmissionMatrix \u00b6 TransmissionMatrix contains the values for the WAIFW matrix that scales the base infectivity. The transmission Route is \u201cContact\u201d. The values are added to Matrix . Matrix specifies the interaction between the \u201cEasy\u201d and \u201cHard\u201d groups. Individuals in the \u201cEasy\u201d group are nine times as likely to be in contact with individuals of their own group. Similarly, individuals in the \u201cHard\u201d accessibility group are five times as likely to interact with their own group. The interpretation for this tutorial is that individuals in the \u201cHard\u201d accessibility group have only 60% of the contacts of those in the \u201cEasy\u201d accessibility group. As an example, \u201cHard\u201d accessibility could be caused by geographic isolation. Age_Bin: Property and Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years \u00b6 The second Property is Age_Bin . Instead of a Values array there is an Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years array that specifies the upper bounds of the age groups. All of the middle values in the Age_Bins_In_Years array specify the upper bound of Age_Bin group that is neither the last nor the first group. This scenario has the following age groups: Birth to age 6 Older than 6 to age 10 Older than 10 to age 20 Older than 20 Age_Bin: Initial_Distribution \u00b6 The Age_Bin property does not support Initial_Distribution . As an age-dependent property, the distribution of the individuals in age bins is determined by the demographics file. Age_Bin: Transitions \u00b6 The Age_Bin property does not use Transitions in IndividualProperties . As an age-dependent property, the membership in an Age_Bin group is updated for individuals as they age. Transitions must be added to the IndividualProperties but it should be empty. Age_Bin: TransmissionMatrix \u00b6 TransmissionMatrix contains the values that scale the base infectivity. The transmission Route is \u201cContact\u201d. The values are added to Matrix . The assumption for this scenario is that individuals interact more frequently with their own age group, and those groups closer in age. Therefore, Matrix has higher values on the diagonal entries.

The three directories are located in ScenariosHINT03_AgeAndAccess. The configuration files are the same in each directory but are copied in each directory to make it more convenient to run simulations.

Pathogenesis and immunity parameters \u00b6 Measles is a highly infectious virus that is typically transmitted by large respiratory and aerosolized droplets. Some transmission also occurs via fomites, however this is believed to be a less significant route for transmission as the virus only survives a short time on dry surfaces. The pathogen is characterized by a high basic reproductive number , often estimated at 16-20 combined with short incubation and infectious periods on the order of days. Immunity conferred is typically lifelong and vaccination has high efficacy (~95%). For more information, see General disease parameters. The following parameters define measles pathogenesis and immunity of an individual. Set the following parameters: Set Enable_Immunity to 1. Set Enable_Immune_Decay to 0. Set Base_Infectivity to 4. Set Base_Incubation_Period to 5. Set Base_Infectious_Period to 5.

A: Baseline outbreak \u00b6 The simulation seeds an initial measles outbreak with a prevalence of 1% in the age group of 10 to 20 years old who are in the \u201cEasy\u201d accessibility group. Age groups do not use the PropertyRestrictions parameter. It uses the Target_Demographic parameter with the value set to \u201cExplicitAgeRanges\u201d, which will use the values in Target_Age_Min and Target_Age_Max . For more information, see Event coordinators parameters.

The number of individuals in the \u201cEasy\u201d and \u201cHard\u201d groups is equal for each age group as specified in the initial distribution. Looking at the number of infected individuals by age and accessibility groups, notice that the numbers are significantly higher (peak prevalence) in the \u201cEasy\u201d accessibility group compared to \u201cHard\u201d. This is due to the decreased transmission rate specified in the accessibility group matrix. Figure 1: Baseline outbreak B: Age-targeted outreach vaccination campaign \u00b6 This simulation adds an age targeted vaccination on day 1 followed by the same outbreak seeding specified in the first scenario on day 2. The campaign configuration file (campaign.json) is in the ScenariosHINT03_AgeAndAccessB_AgeTargetedVaccine directory.

Notice the dramatic decrease (an order of magnitude) of the infection in 6 to 10 year olds due to the vaccination of this group. Compare infections in other ages, noting the overall decrease in infection across age groups despite the fact that only 6 to 10 year olds were vaccinated. Figure 2: Age-targeted outreach vaccination campaign C: Standard vaccination campaign \u00b6 On day 1, a non-targeted vaccination campaign begins which reaches all those individuals in the \u201cEasy\u201d accessibility group but does not reach those in the \u201cHard\u201d accessibility group. This is followed by an outbreak that originates in the \u201cHard\u201d accessibility group in the 0.5 to 6 year olds. In the first two scenarios, the outbreak originated in the \u201cEasy\u201d accessibility group among older children. This outbreak begins in the \u201cHard\u201d accessibility group.

Figure 3: Easy accessibility targeted vaccine\u2013Accessibility easy group Notice the almost complete elimination of infection in the \u201cEasy\u201d accessibility group due to 95% vaccination coverage with a 95% take. There is only a slight reduction in infection in the \u201cHard\u201d accessibility group which was not reachable by vaccination in this campaign. Recall that the epidemic was seeded in the \u201cHard\u201d accessibility group. Figure 4: Easy accessibility targeted vaccine\u2013Accessibility hard group Exploring the model \u00b6 Adjust both the targeted age and accessibility groups of the initial outbreak. In IndividualProperties , decrease the value of the off-diagonal entries in the TransmissionMatrix . Investigate how this slows down the spread of measles to the other age and accessibility groups in terms of both the speed of the disease spread and total incidence of the disease. For one age and/or accessibility group, set all interactions with other groups to zero. To do this for the n th population group, set all values of the n th row to 0 except for the diagonal entry (n th column and n th row), which should remain unchanged. Use the campaign cost output, which is proportional to the number of doses, to compare the cost- effectiveness of vaccination campaigns targeted at different age and accessibility groups. Also adjust coverage in different groups. For example, the following Matrix values configure the interactions with other group for the third age group (older than 10 to 20 years). { \"Matrix\" : [ [ 0.4 , 0.2 , 0.10 , 0.3 ], [ 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.10 , 0.3 ], [ 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.6 , 0.0 ], [ 0.1 , 0.1 , 0.10 , 0.7 ] ] } Verify that if the epidemic started in a different group, it cannot spread to this group. How do results of the third scenario change if the infection is seeded in the \u201cEasy\u201d accessibility group? See that the infection fails to spread to the \u201cHard\u201d accessibility group. Lower the vaccination coverage of the \u201cEasy\u201d accessibility group to find the vaccination level where the spread to the Hard accessibility group occurs.", "tags": "", "title": "HINT 3: Age and accessibility \u2014 Training Tutorials  documentation"}, {"url": "./hint-tutorial-scenario4.html", "text": "HINT 4: Washington state pertussis \u00b6 The Washington state pertussis tutorial highlights several important features of the 2012 pertussis outbreak in Washington state. These features include the timing and spatial pattern of the spreading outbreak, the relationship between vaccine-derived immunity levels in different population groups and disease incidence over the course of the outbreak, and the effects of within-age-group mixing and the switch from whole-cell to acellular vaccines on incidence in different age groups. The Washington state pertussis tutorial consists of two scenarios: The baseline outbreak scenario initializes the historical vaccination of vaccine-accepting individuals before introducing a pertussis outbreak in Skagit county and letting it spread throughout the state. The supporting configuration and campaign files are in ScenariosHINT04_WAPertussisA_BaselineOutbreak. The target vaccine refusers scenario uses the baseline outbreak setup with the addition of a targeted vaccination before the outbreak of the previously vaccine-refusing populations in Snohomish, King, and Pierce counties. The supporting configuration and campaign files are in ScenariosHINT04_WAPertussisB_TargetVaccineRefusers.

For more information, see Demographics file structure and parameters . Geography and population \u00b6 Each of Washington state counties is specified as a geographical node with population estimates by county from 2013 WA State Office of Financial Management and geographic location (latitude and longitude) centered on county seats. The following code example is for the first county (node) listed in the demographics file. { \"Nodes\" : [{ \"County\" : \"Adams\" , \"NodeAttributes\" : { \"Latitude\" : 47.1274 , \"InitialPopulation\" : 19200 , \"Longitude\" : -118.38 }, \"NodeID\" : 1 }] } IndividualAttributes \u00b6 The initial age distribution is a uniform distribution of individuals between the ages of 0 and 60 years old. { \"Defaults\" : { \"NodeAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualAttributes\" : { \"AgeDistribution_DESCRIPTION\" : \"Box between age 0 and 60 years: Age_Initialization_Distribution_Type=DISTRIBUTION_SIMPLE\" , \"AgeDistributionFlag\" : 1 , \"AgeDistribution1\" : 0 , \"AgeDistribution2\" : 21900 } } } Age-specific mortality is taken from Washington statewide numbers from CDC 1999-2010 in annual deaths per 1000 individuals. { \"Defaults\" : { \"NodeAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualAttributes\" : { \"MortalityDistribution_DESCRIPTION\" : \"WA state (1999-2010).

The IndividualProperties configuration is in the hint_wapertussis_demographics_overlay file. Accessibility: Property and Values \u00b6 The Property and Values parameters define two Accessibility groups: VaccineTake and VaccineRefuse . Accessibility will be used to initialize the population with differential vaccination coverage. Individuals are randomly assigned one of these two values at birth and do not transition afterwards. { \"Defaults\" : { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"Property\" : \"Accessibility\" , \"Values\" : [ \"VaccineTake\" , \"VaccineRefuse\" ], \"Initial_Distribution\" : [ 0.85 , 0.15 ], \"Transitions\" : [] }] } } Accessibility: Initial_Distribution \u00b6 At the beginning of the simulation, individuals have an 85% chance of being assigned to VaccineTake and a 15% chance to VaccineRefuse as specified by the Initial_Distribution array. Accessibility: Transitions \u00b6 In this simulation, individuals will not transition from one Accessibility group to the other therefore the Transitions structure is empty. Accessibility: TransmissionMatrix \u00b6 The specification of enhanced within-group interaction is specified by the WAIFW matrix between the two groups: VaccineTake and VaccineRefuse . For example, a VaccineRefuse -type individual is 5 times more likely (compared to homogeneous mixing) to be exposed to infections from another individual within their group and 0.3 times as likely to be exposed to an individual outside their group. The transmission Route is \u201cContact\u201d. The values of the WAIFW matrix for the heterogeneous mixing between the Accessibility groups is defined in Matrix . { \"Defaults\" : { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"TransmissionMatrix\" : { \"Route\" : \"Contact\" , \"Matrix\" : [ [ 1.1 , 0.3 ], [ 0.3 , 5.0 ] ] } }] } } Age_Bin: Property and Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years \u00b6 The second Property is Age_Bin . Three age bins are defined by the Age_Bins_In_Years array with heterogeneous mixing defined by the following TransmissionMatrix. The beginning 0 and ending -1 are mandatory elements in the Age_Bins_In_Years array. The 0 is the lower bound for the first Age_Bin group and specifies birth. The -1 is the upper bound of the last Age_Bin group and specifies the maximum age of the simulation. All of the middle values in the Age_Bins_In_Years array specify the upper bound of Age_Bin group that is neither the last nor the first group. This simulation has the following age groups: Birth to age 5 Older than 5 to age 13 Older than 13 { \"Defaults\" : { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"Property\" : \"Age_Bin\" , \"Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years\" : [ 0 , 5 , 13 , -1 ], \"Transitions\" : [] }] } } Age_Bin: Initial_Distribution \u00b6 The Age_Bin Property type does not support Initial_Distribution . As an age-dependent property, the distribution of the individuals in age bins is determined by the demographics file. Age_Bin: Transitions \u00b6 The Age_Bin property does not use Transitions . As an age-dependent property, the membership in an Age_Bin group is updated for each individual as he or she ages. Transitions must be added to the IndividualProperties but it should be empty. Age_Bin: TransmissionMatrix \u00b6 TransmissionMatrix contains the values of the WAIFW matrix that scale the base infectivity. The transmission Route is \u201cContact\u201d. The heterogeneous mixing between the age groups is defined in Matrix . { \"Defaults\" : { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"TransmissionMatrix\" : { \"Route\" : \"Contact\" , \"Matrix\" : [ [ 1.4 , 1.0 , 1.0 ], [ 1.0 , 2.5 , 0.7 ], [ 1.0 , 0.7 , 1.0 ] ] } }] } } IndividualProperties for Accessibility and Age_Bin \u00b6 { \"Defaults\" : { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"Property\" : \"Accessibility\" , \"Values\" : [ \"VaccineTake\" , \"VaccineRefuse\" ], \"Initial_Distribution\" : [ 0.85 , 0.15 ], \"Transitions\" : [], \"TransmissionMatrix\" : { \"Route\" : \"Contact\" , \"Matrix\" : [ [ 1.1 , 0.3 ], [ 0.3 , 5.0 ] ] } }, { \"Property\" : \"Age_Bin\" , \"Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years\" : [ 0 , 5 , 13 , -1 ], \"Transitions\" : [], \"TransmissionMatrix\" : { \"Route\" : \"Contact\" , \"Matrix\" : [ [ 1.4 , 1.0 , 1.0 ], [ 1.0 , 2.5 , 0.7 ], [ 1.0 , 0.7 , 1.0 ] ] } }] } } For more information on IndividualProperties , see Heterogeneous Intra-Node Transmission (HINT). Migration \u00b6 The daily migration rates between the various counties are taken from daily commuter data and are packed into the binary file in hint_wapertussis_regional_migration.bin. These rates are most likely a lower bound on actual migration, especially between more distant counties, as they consider only daily commutes and not other longer-range modes. Key configuration parameters \u00b6 Enable_Heterogeneous_Intranode_Transmission must be set to 1 to enable the TransmissionMatrix structure in IndividualProperties . For more information, see Demographics parameters. Each scenario has a directory (A_BaselineOutbreak and B_TargetVaccineRefusers) that contains a configuration files (config.json) file. The two directories are located in ScenariosHINT04_WAPertussis. The configuration files are the same but are copied in each directory to make it more convenient to run simulations. Pertussis disease parameters \u00b6 The generic-disease-model parameters are configured to approximate the dynamics of pertussis. There is a 7-day fixed incubation period followed by an infectious period drawn from an exponential with a mean duration of 22 days. The product of the daily infectiousness (0.6) and the mean infectious duration corresponds to an R 0 of about 14. For more information, see General disease parameters. Set the following parameters: Set Base_Infectivity to 0.6. Set Base_Infectious_Period to 22. Set Base_Incubation_Period to 7. Set Incubation_Period_Distribution to \u201cFIXED_DURATION.\u201d Set Infectious_Period_Distribution to \u201cEXPONENTIAL_DURATION.\u201d Upon clearing natural pertussis infections, individuals are configured to have complete protection against re-acquisition for a duration of 4 years. After 4 years, the protection wanes exponentially with a time constant of 16 years. The reduced transmission potential of immune individuals is configured to follow a similar waning pattern. Set the following parameters: Set Immunity_Acquisition_Factor to 0. Set Acquisition_Blocking_Immunity_Duration_Before_Decay to 1460. Set Acquisition_Blocking_Immunity_Decay_Rate to 0.00017. Adapted population sampling \u00b6 The simulation is configured to use adapted sampling rates in the various nodes as a function of population size. This improves the computing time of the simulation while minimizing the effect of over-sampling, (i.e. a compromised representation of the small-number stochastic effects). The maximum number of sampled individuals in any given node is configured to be 1000. For example, a county with 2 million individuals would have 1000 samples each with weight=2000, while a county with 10,000 individuals would have 1000 samples each with weight=10. For more information, see Sampling parameters. Set the following parameters: Set Individual_Sampling_Type to \u201cADAPTED_SAMPLING_BY_POPULATION_SIZE.\u201d Set Max_Node_Population_Samples to 1000. Migration \u00b6 The regional migration between nodes has been configured in a commute-driven mode with all migration events consisting of single round-trips where the migrating individual draws a duration of his or her stay from an exponential with a mean of one day before returning with probability = 1 to the home node. Without regenerating the binary migration file, it is possible to scale all regional migration rates up and down with the x_Regional_Migration multiplicative parameter. For more information, see:ref: Migration <config-migration> parameters. Set the following parameters: Set Migration_Pattern to \u201cSINGLE_ROUND_TRIPS.\u201d Set Regional_Migration_Roundtrip_Duration to 1. Set Regional_Migration_Roundtrip_Probability to 1. Interventions \u00b6 You can see the complete campaign.json in ScenariosHINT04_WAPertussis. Initialization of population immunity \u00b6 A ten-year burn-in allows for the age-structure of the vaccination schedule (including waning) to be initialized. Four vaccine-distribution events are specified in the campaign file, each targeted only at individuals with the \u201cVaccineTake\u201d value for the \u201cAccessibility\u201d property in the demographics file. For more information, see SimpleVaccine . A vaccination calendar to all children under 12 years old, so that the rest of their childhood vaccinations are distributed as they age: 2 month, 4 month, 6 month, 17 month, 5 year, 11.5 year with 90% coverage at the fourth dose and 95% on each of the last two doses. { \"Calendar\" : [{ \"Age\" : 60 , \"Probability\" : 1 }, { \"Age\" : 120 , \"Probability\" : 1 }, { \"Age\" : 180 , \"Probability\" : 1 }, { \"Age\" : 510 , \"Probability\" : 0.9 }, { \"Age\" : 1825 , \"Probability\" : 0.95 }, { \"Age\" : 4200 , \"Probability\" : 0.95 }], \"Dropout\" : 0 , \"class\" : \"IVCalendar\" } A birth-triggered distribution of the same calendar to newborns as they are born throughout the simulation. A health-seeking behavior for people over 12 years old to seek booster doses with a daily tendency (0.000548) corresponding to a 5-year mean waiting time. A dose to over-12s at the beginning of the simulation to prime their immune systems to account for their historic childhood vaccination. The acellular pertussis vaccine is configured such that 95% of vaccinated individuals, for whom the vaccine takes, will have an initial 90% reduction in the probability of acquiring infection per exposure and a 60% reduction in their transmission potential if infected. The protection wanes exponentially (DECAYDURABILITY) with a time constant of approximately 7 years. { \"Cost_To_Consumer\" : 20.0 , \"Durability_Time_Profile\" : \"DECAYDURABILITY\" , \"Primary_Decay_Time_Constant\" : 2525 , \"Reduced_Acquire\" : 0.9 , \"Reduced_Transmit\" : 0.6 , \"Reduced_Mortality\" : 1 , \"Vaccine_Take\" : 0.95 , \"Vaccine_Type\" : \"Generic\" , \"class\" : \"SimpleVaccine\" } The initial immunity given to the over-12 population is intended to capture the slightly more immunogenic whole-cell vaccine, which is configured with 90% initial protection against both acquisition and transmission as well as a longer 20-year decay time. Targeted outbreak \u00b6 As a demonstration of the ability to target an outbreak at both a geographical region (or set of nodes) and at a target population (based on IndividualProperties ), this simulation has two OutbreakIndividual interventions. The first (shown below) is distributed 10 years into the simulation and infects 1% of the \u201cVaccineTake\u201d population in the specified list of nodes (in this case only Skagit county with NodeID = 57). The other intervention, distributed 100 days later, infects 10% of the \u201cVaccineRefuse\u201d population in the same county. { \"Campaign_Name\" : \"Washington State Pertussis Outbreak\" , \"Event_Coordinator_Config\" : { \"Intervention_Config\" : { \"Antigen\" : 0 , \"Genome\" : 0 , \"Outbreak_Source\" : \"PrevalenceIncrease\" , \"class\" : \"OutbreakIndividual\" }, \"Demographic_Coverage\" : 0.01 , \"Number_Repetitions\" : 1 , \"Target_Demographic\" : \"Everyone\" , \"Property_Restrictions\" : [ \"Accessibility:VaccineTake\" ], \"class\" : \"StandardInterventionDistributionEventCoordinator\" }, \"Nodeset_Config\" : { \"Node_List\" : [ 57 ], \"County_DESCRIPTION\" : \"Skagit\" , \"class\" : \"NodeSetNodeList\" }, \"Start_Day\" : 3650 , \"class\" : \"CampaignEvent\" } Run the simulation \u00b6 Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see How to run Quick Start simulations . Note Because the EMOD model is stochastic , your graphs may appear slightly different from those given below. Spatial spread \u00b6 The Plot_Infections_By_Node.py script unpacks the SpatialOutput binary files, which are written out for each channel listed in the configuration parameter, Spatial_Output_Channels , provided that Enable_Spatial_Output is set to 1. For more information, see Output options and Spatial output channels parameters. The following plot shows the daily incidence of new infections for a representative sampling of counties in the simulation. From top to bottom, one can see the characteristic evolution of each local outbreak, starting in Skagit county and progressing southward through Snohomish and King counties down to Clark county on the Oregon border. Similarly, there is a delay before the outbreak makes it over Cascades into the Tri-Cities (Benton and Franklin counties) and Spokane areas. Figure 1: Daily incidence of new infections in representative sample of counties Incidence in different groups \u00b6 The Plot_Infections_by_Property.py script parses the output of the PropertyReport.json file (provided that Enable_Property_Output is set to 1) and plots the output channels grouped according to the property values specified within the script. In the following example, the total number of cases and the population-normalized incidence is compared between the \u201cVaccineTake\u201d and \u201cVaccineRefuse\u201d groups. Figure 2: Population-normalized incidence of new infection by accessibility groups Incidence by age \u00b6 Finally, the Plot_Age_Distributions.py script parses the BinnedReport.json output (provided that Enable_Demographics_Reporting is set to 1) and plots the population in each age bin through time and also the cumulative incidence of infection in age bins as shown below. Figure 3: Population of age bins and cumulated incidence Exploring the model \u00b6 There are a number of different areas that one could explore within this tutorial: Modifying the vaccination coverage, efficacy, and waning values to see the impact on the size and make-up of the effected populations. Modifying the migration rates and county-level variation in vaccine-derived immunity to see the impact on the spatio-temporal pattern of the spreading outbreak. Modifying the heterogeneous mixing within age groups and the relative protective efficacy of the whole-cell and acellular vaccines to see the impact on the age distribution of the effected population. Introducing targeted interventions before the outbreak to minimize its impact. As an example, the last category is provided in the directory ScenariosHINT04_WAPertussisB_TargetVaccineRefusers and consists of a targeted vaccination 100 days before the outbreak that reaches 95% of the previously unvaccinated VaccineRefuse population in the three most-populous counties: King, Snohomish and Pierce.

The tutorial assumes that individuals have round-trip travels, or commutes, between census tracts in less than one day. The return time is less than or equal to 8 hours and movement is in equilibrium. Different from homogeneous mixing, the heterogeneous movement links and rates between census tracts will create a timing difference of epidemic trajectories upon initial seeding. The tutorial represents Seattle as a single node. There are 125 groups based on Seattle census tract data. The heterogeneous infectivity between individuals and the 125 groups is represented by a WAIFW matrix with values. The values, which represent the heterogeneous force of infection at each census tract, are based on the movement rate between census tracts and the return rate. Individuals interact mostly with other individuals in their own census tract but also shed into or acquire infection from the census tracts that they commuted to during the day.

For more information, see Demographics file structure and parameters . Generating Seattle as a single node \u00b6 The hint_seattlecommuting_demographics file was generated from the multi-node Seattle_30arcsec_demographics file, the Seattle_30arcsec_local_migration file, and the Seattle_30arcsec_regional_migration file using the Python script ConvertMultipleNodeDemographicsToSingleNodePools. The script also added the IndividualProperties attribute that is needed for this tutorial. The ConvertMultipleNodeDemographicsToSingleNodePools Python file, Seattle_Template, which is a copy of the hint_seattlecommuting_demographics file, and the three multi-node input files are in the ScenariosHINT05_SeattleCommutingscript directory. IndividualProperties \u00b6 For more information, see IndividualProperties parameters. Property and Values \u00b6 The Property and Values parameters of IndividualProperties define 125 groups based on Seattle census tracts. The Property type must be \u201cGeographic\u201d as it is the only property that supports 125 Values . The Values are the 3-digit ID for the 125 Seattle census tracts for Seattle. Initial_Distribution \u00b6 Initial_Distribution is an array with 125 elements. See the hint_seattlecommuting_demographics file for those values. Transitions \u00b6 Individuals will not move from one Seattle census track to the other so Transitions is empty. TransmissionMatrix \u00b6 TransmissionMatrix contains the values that scale the base infectivity. The transmission Route is \u201cContact\u201d. The values are added to Matrix . The Matrix was created using a script with a specified return rate. The script loads the existing multi-node demographics and migration input files, and converts them to a single-node demographics file. Each component in the TransmissionMatrix is calculated based on the spatial coupling of round- trip movement flow detailed in the article: Balcan, D., Colizza, V., Gon\u00e7alves, B., et al. (2009).

Since the average hours to stay at a destination is 8 hours (1/3 of a day) and the return rate is the inverse of the average hours, the return rate is 3. That is, . There are 125 Seattle census tracts so the Matrix is a 125 x 125 matrix.

Expected simulation output \u00b6 This tutorial shows the timing difference of disease spread between groups due to spatial coupling. It has 125 groups that represent the census tracts in Seattle and simulates a daily commute between the census tracts. The following Inset Charts shows the daily number of infected people for each census tract in the simulation sorted by census tract ID. The census tracts are sequentially ordered with the census tract with the lowest number at the top of the graph. the graph shows the difference in timing between census tracts in terms of the disease spread. Figure 1: Number of infected people per census tract Exploring the model \u00b6 Change the return rates to either increase or decrease the spatial coupling when generating the demographic input and transmission matrix. In general, when the return rates are high, there is less coupling between census tracts so the disease curves of the outbreak are less synchronized. The following example shows a less synchronized behavior of disease spread when the return rate = 24 (people spend 1 hour on average at their destination) with the outbreak targeted at \u201cGeographic: 7\u201d in the demographics file. Updating a demographics file \u00b6 You can manually modify the the Seattle_template provided in the ScenariosHINT05_SeattleCommutingscript directory. However, because of the size of the TransmissionMatrix, you might want to use the Python scripts (also in ScenariosHINT05_SeattleCommutingscript) to modify the Seattle_template and regenerate the demographics file. Update the value of returnRate in ConvertMultipleNodeDemographicsToSingleNodePools using an editor of your choice. Note All of the multi-node demographics files and Seattle_template must be in the same directory. For example, the following Inset Chart graph shows decreased spatial coupling after modifying the demographics file.

The primary software, Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD), helps determine the combination of health policies and intervention strategies that can lead to disease eradication. We share this modeling software with the research community to advance the understanding of disease dynamics. However, if you are not already familiar with epidemiology and disease modeling, it can be challenging to get started with EMOD. This training documentation provides extensive tutorials that walk you through prepared modeling scenarios. In addition, you can easily run simulations with the Quick Start using the provided Windows batch files or within the familiar interface of the Excel Front End. Note The Quick Start can only be run locally on a 64-bit Windows computer and the Excel Front End is only supported on 32-bit Microsoft Excel, though there is a workaround if you do not want to reinstall your version of Excel. See Troubleshooting . The Quick Start is not updated as frequently as the EMOD source, so may not contain all parameters available in the latest version of EMOD. In addition, while you can modify the parameter values, you cannot add or subtract parameters from JSON files within the Excel Front End. Documentation structure \u00b6 IDM recently separated the documentation into this training set and disease-specific sets that provide guidance for researchers modeling particular diseases.

It also contains directories for many different real-world scenarios that you can model, each of which includes the necessary input data files , configuration file , and campaign file . You can easily run simulations with the provided Windows batch files or within the familiar interface of the Excel Front End. After you complete installation, we recommend that you walk through the tutorials that describe the underlying mathematics of EMOD, starting with the generic tutorials that demonstrate the basic SEIR model framework before moving on to the disease-specific tutorials. Note The Quick Start can only be run locally on a 64-bit Windows computer and the Excel Front End is only supported on 32-bit Microsoft Excel, though there is a workaround if you do not want to reinstall your version of Excel. See Troubleshooting . The Quick Start is not updated as frequently as the EMOD source, so may not contain all parameters available in the latest version of EMOD. In addition, while you can modify the parameter values, you cannot add or subtract parameters from JSON files within the Excel Front End. Download the Quick Start \u00b6 Go to the EMOD-QuickStart GitHub repository. From the Clone or download menu, select Download ZIP . On your local computer, download and unzip the file to a location of your choice. Warning You must not save the Quick Start to a network drive or include any spaces in the path to the location or the environment setup will fail. Within the EMOD-QuickStart-master directory, you will see Eradication.exe, the EMOD application, various files for setting up the environment and running simulations, and the Scenarios directory, which contains all required files for modeling various scenarios described in the tutorials. Within the Scenarios directory, each subdirectory corresponds to a tutorial section and contains the scenarios associated with those tutorials. The exceptions to this rule are EmbeddingPython, which does not yet have tutorials, InputFiles, which contains the input data files used by all scenarios, and Scripts, which contains the scripts used to plot the simulation output. Set up the Quick Start environment \u00b6 The Quick Start assumes all directories are located on the virtual Z drive, regardless of where you physically save them. The following setup script configures environment variables so that the tools, such as the Excel Front End, can access the correct location. Open the EMOD-QuickStart-master directory. Double-click the EMOD Environment shortcut to launch the command window in the virtual Z drive. If a Security Warning appears, click Open to ignore it. This runs the setenv.bat file, which temporarily sets up the Path and Python_Path environment variables. From the command line, enter dir . The directories and files will be listed if the environment is correctly set up. If the directories and files are not listed, this indicates that your virtual Z drive is already being used. Use the steps below to select another virtual drive and update some of the Quick Start files to use the other virtual drive. (Optional) Set up a different virtual drive \u00b6 In following example, the Quick Start is edited to use the virtual drive A. Modify the instructions as necessary if you want to use a different virtual drive. Open the EMOD-QuickStart-master directory. In the setenv.cmd script, replace all occurrences of \u201cZ\u201d with \u201cA\u201d. In the emod.bat script, replace all occurrences of \u201cZ\u201d with \u201cA\u201d. In each scenario directory, in each Excel configuration file, in cell B2 of the Commissioning sheet, replace \u201cZ\u201d with \u201cA\u201d. If you want to use embedded Python, in ScenariosEmbeddingPython, in the emod.bat script, replace all occurrences of \u201cZ\u201d with \u201cA\u201d. After updating the files to the virtual drive A, double-click the EMOD Environment shortcut to see if the command window opens in the virtual drive A and displays the Quick Start directories and files. (Optional) Install plotting software \u00b6 None of the following plotting software is required to run simulations with the Quick Start, but they are useful for creating graphs from and evaluating the model output. When you install the Quick Start, Python and and the package manager, pip, is also installed. When you run Quick Start simulations, the Quick Start automatically runs Python scripts to create graphs of the output. These scripts also require you to install the software packages listed below. However, most of these graphs are reproduced in the documentation if you do not want to install additional software to create the graphs yourself. Note that all batch files assume that Python is installed at C:Python27. If you already have Python installed in a different location, use a plain text editor to modify the path in the batch files. Note IDM does not provide support or guarantees for any third-party software, even software that we recommend you install. Send feedback if you encounter any issues, but any support must come from the makers of those software packages and their user communities. We recommended that you download some of the Python packages from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs , a page compiled by Christoph Gohlke, University of California, Irvine. The libraries there are compiled Windows binaries, including the 64-bit versions required by EMOD. Python utilities \u00b6 The Quick Start Python scripts require the Python utilities dateutil, six, and pyparsing. The Python utilities dateutil, six, and pyparsing provide text parsing and datetime functionality. Open a Command Prompt window. Enter the following commands: pip install python - dateutil pip install pyparsing NumPy \u00b6 The Quick Start Python scripts require the NumPy Python package. The NumPy package adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices to Python.

It is hierarchically organized into logical groups of parameters that can have arbitrary levels of nesting. For some interventions, there can be a very complex hierarchical structure, including recursion. Typically, the file is named campaign.json. The relative path to this file is specified by Campaign_Filename in the configuration file. To distribute an intervention, you must configure the following: campaign event A JSON object that determines when and where an intervention is distributed during a campaign. event coordinator A JSON object that determines who will receive a particular intervention during a campaign. intervention A JSON object that determines what will be distributed to reduce the spread of a disease. An intervention can be distributed either to an individual (such as a vaccine, drug, or bednet) or to a node (such as a larvicide). Sometimes this can be an intermediate intervention that schedules another intervention. The Quick Start includes complete simulation scenarios in the Scenarios directory.

For example, the number of individuals, geographic data, climate, demographics, and migration data. This is in contrast to the demographic, geographic, and migration parameters in the configuration file that control simulation-wide qualities, such as enabling air migration across all nodes in the simulation. Although a demographics file is the only required input data file, additional files are generally needed for a realistic simulation. The demographics files use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) . The other input data files use both a JSON file for metadata and an associated binary file that contains the actual data. The Quick Start includes all necessary input data files in the Scenarios/InputFiles directory. Demographics \u00b6 Demographics files are JSON formatted files containing information on the demographics of the population in a geographical region to simulate. For example, the number of individuals and the distribution for age, gender, immunity, risk, and mortality. In addition, demographics files are useful for creating heterogeneous groups within a population. You can define values for accessibility, age, geography, risk, and other properties and assign individuals to groups based on those property values. For example, you might want to divide a population up into different bins based on age so you can target interventions to individuals in a particular age range. Another common use is to configure treatment coverage to be higher for individuals in easily accessible regions and lower for individuals in areas that are difficult to access. EMOD assumes homogeneous mixing and disease transmission for the generic simulation type. You can use the HINT feature to add heterogeneous transmission to your generic model. You cannot manually configure heterogeneous transmission using HINT with other simulation types because the heterogeneity in transmission for specific diseases and disease classes is already configured by the simulation type. You can specify multiple demographics files, which function as a \u201cbase layer\u201d file and one or more \u201coverlay\u201d files that override the base layer configuration. Overlay files can change the value of parameters already specified in the base layer or add new parameters. Support for multiple demographics layers allows for the following scenarios: Separating different sets of parameters and values into individual layers (for example, to separate those that are useful for specific diseases into different layers) Adding new parameters for a simulation into a new layer for easier prototyping Overriding certain parameters of interest in a new layer Overriding certain parameters for a particular sub-region Simulating subsets of a larger region for which input data files have been constructed Migration \u00b6 Migration files describe the rate of migration of individuals in and out of a geographic node . There are four types of migration files that can be used by EMOD: local migration, regional migration, air migration, and sea migration. For all types, migration data is contained in a set of two files, a JSON metadata file with header information and a binary data file with the actual migration data. Both files are required. The basic file structure is identical for all types, with the only exception being the number of columns per row allowed to each type. Local \u00b6 Local migration describes the foot travel of people into and out of adjacent nodes. A local migration file is required for simulations that support more than one node. Regional \u00b6 Regional migration describes migration via a road or rail network. If a node is not part of the network, the regional migration of individuals to and from that node considers the closest road hub city. When you create the migration file, you must create a Voronoi tiling based on road hubs of the region, with each non-hub connected to the hub of its tile. Air \u00b6 Air migration describes migration via airplane travel. It is usually required for simulations of an entire country or larger geographies. Sea \u00b6 Sea migration describes migration via ship. Climate \u00b6 There are two general types of climate files usable by EMOD: climate files generated through actual data, referred to as \u201cclimate by data,\u201d and climate files generated from the Koppen classification system, referred to as \u201cclimate by Koppen.\u201d For both types, climate data is contained in a set of two files, a JSON metadata file with header information and a binary file that contains the actual climate data. Both files are required. Climate by data \u00b6 Climate by data files contain real data gathered from weather stations in the region to be simulated. This includes rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, and so on. Climate by Koppen \u00b6 Climate by Koppen files contain the Koppen classifier for the region. The Koppen classification system is one of the most widely used climate classification systems. It makes the assumption that native vegetation is the best reflection of climate.", "tags": "", "title": "Input data files \u2014 Training Tutorials  documentation"}, {"url": "./intro-modeling.html", "text": "Introduction to disease modeling \u00b6 To understand the complex dynamics underlying disease transmission, epidemiologists utilize a set of models called compartmental models. Developed in the early 20th century, these models stratify a population into groups, generally based on their risk or infection status. Underlying these models is a system of differential equations, so the model is able to track the population as a function of time. Further, the models track the number of people in each category, are able to predict the various properties of pathogen spread, can estimate the duration of epidemics, and can be used to understand how different situations or interventions can impact the outcome of pathogen spread. To see a typical plot of a population in SIR conditions, see the plot in Types of compartmental models . If you would like a more in-depth introduction to epidemiology and disease modeling, you may want to take the Epidemics course from The Pennsylvania State University through Coursera. An agent-based model (ABM) is another powerful tool used to help understand the complexity inherent in disease transmission systems. These models form a type of \u201cmicroscale model,\u201d where they simulate the simultaneous interactions of agents in an effort to re-crate complex phenomena. Each agent (such as a human, or vector) can be assigned a variety of \u201cproperties\u201d (for example, age, gender, etc), and their behavior and interactions with one another are determined by using decision rules. These models have strong predictive power, and are able to leverage spatial and temporal dynamics. Further, complex environments can be developed in which the agents act, and agents may \u201clearn\u201d from interactions or \u201cadapt\u201d to their environment. As a result, ABMs are excellent for identifying \u201cemerging properties\u201d of the system: patterns that are not explicitly modeled, but instead occur as a consequence of the rules that govern the agents. Agent-based models are extensively used in epidemiology due to their predictive power in modeling the spread (or conversely, control) of epidemics. A popular type of ABM for this is one in which each agent\u2019s rules follow the dynamics specified in the compartmental models, where each agent flows through the compartments as a function of both \u201cwithin-host\u201d rules (such as duration of infection) and interactions between agents (such as becoming infected when coming into contact with an infectious agent). By combining the epidemiological basis of compartmental models with the flexibility of an agent-based model, this type of ABM is quite powerful due to their ability to simultaneously address the ecology, epidemiology, and pathology of complex systems. Why use disease modeling \u00b6 Disease models play an important role in understanding and managing the transmission dynamics of various pathogens. We can use them to describe the spatial and temporal patterns of disease prevalence, as well as to explore or better understand the factors that influence infection incidence. Modeling is a key step in understanding what treatments and interventions can be most effective, how cost-effective these approaches may be, and what specific factors need to be considered when trying to eradicate disease. Types of compartmental models \u00b6 The following diagrams illustrate common compartmental models. See the Generic simulation tutorials in the Training documentation set for more information, as well as exercises on running EMOD simulations utilizing these models. SIR Plot, showing typical categorization of a population into Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered states. Definitions \u00b6 Susceptible Individual is able to become infected. Exposed Individual has been infected with a pathogen, but due to the pathogen\u2019s incubation period, is not yet infectious. Infectious Individual is infected with a pathogen and is capable of transmitting the pathogen to others. Recovered Individual is either no longer infectious, or \u201cremoved\u201d from the population. SI (Susceptible - Infectious) model \u00b6 In this situation, people never leave the infectious state and have life-long infections. For example, herpes is a disease with life-long infectiousness. The dashed line shows how the model becomes an SIS (Susceptible - Infectious - Susceptible) model, where infection does not confer immunity (or there is waning immunity). Individuals have repeat or reoccurring infections, and infected individuals return to the susceptible state. For example, sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea or chlamydia fall into this group. SI - SIS model SIR (Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered) model \u00b6 In this category, individuals in the recovered state gain immunity to the pathogen. For example, measles, mumps, rubella, and pertussis may be modeled using the SIR framework. The dashed line shows how the model becomes an SIRS (Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered - Susceptible) model, where recovery does not confer life-long immunity, and individuals may become susceptible again. SIR - SIRS model SEIR (Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered) model \u00b6 In this category, individuals experience a long incubation duration (the \u201cexposed\u201d category), such that the individual is infected but not yet infectious . For example chicken pox, and even vector-borne diseases such as Dengue Hemorrhagic fever have a long incubation duration where the individual cannot yet transmit the pathogen to others. The dashed line shows how the model becomes an SEIRS (Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered - Susceptible) model, where recovered people may become susceptible again (recovery does not confer life-long immunity). For example, rotovirus and malaria are diseases with long incubation durations, and where infection only confers temporary immunity. SEIR - SEIRS model Fundamental concepts in epidemiology and disease modeling \u00b6 Basic reproductive number (R 0 ) The average number of secondary infections generated by the first infectious individual in a population of completely susceptible individuals. R 0 =S*L* (where S = the number of susceptible hosts, L = length of infection, and = transmissibility). When R 0 > 1, disease will spread. It is essentially a measure of the expected or average outcome of transmission. This is the threshold parameter used to determine whether or not an epidemic will occur, and determines: The initial rate of increase of an epidemic (the exponential growth phase). The final size of an epidemic (what fraction of susceptibles will be infected). The endemic equilibrium fraction of susceptibles in a population (=1/ R 0 ). The critical vaccination threshold, which is equal to 1-(1/ R 0 ), and determines the number of people that must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of a pathogen. Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) The number of years of life lost due to premature mortality plus the years lost due to disability while infected. Used to quantify the burden of disease. Epidemic An outbreak of an infectious disease, such that a greater number of individuals than normal has the disease. Epidemics have very high R 0 (Recall R 0 >1 for a disease to spread) and are often associated with acute, highly transmissible pathogens that can be directly transmitted. Further, pathogens with lower infectious periods create more explosive epidemics. To control epidemics, it is necessary to reduce R 0 . This can be done by: Reducing transmissibility. Decreasing the number of susceptibles (by vaccination, for example). Decreasing the mean number of contacts or the transmissibility, such as by improving sanitation, or limiting the number of interactions sick people have with healthy people. Reducing length of infectious period. Force of infection (FoI) A measure of the degree to which an infected individual can spread infection; the per-capita rate at which susceptibles contract infection. Typically increases with transmissibility and prevalence of infection. Herd immunity Vaccines protect individuals, but also provide indirect protection to anyone those vaccinated people may have infected. The portion of the population that needs to be immunized in order to achieve herd immunity is P > 1 \u2013 (1/ R 0 ), where P = proportion vaccinated * vaccine efficacy. Incidence (of a pathogen) The number of new cases or infections in a given time period. Immune Unable to become infected/infectious Prevalence (of a pathogen) The proportion of a population that is infectious at any given time. Transmissibility ( ) Also known as the effective contact rate, is the product of the contact rate and the probability of transmission per contact. Virulence The capacity of a pathogen to produce disease. It is proportional to parasitemia, or the number of circulating copies of the pathogen in the host. The higher the virulence (given contact between S and I individuals), the more likely transmission is to occur. However, higher virulence means contact may be less likely as infected hosts show more symptoms of the disease. There is a trade-off that occurs between high transmissibility and disease-induced mortality.", "tags": "", "title": "Introduction to disease modeling \u2014 Training Tutorials  documentation"}, {"url": "./intro-outputs.html", "text": "Output files \u00b6 After running a simulation, the simulation data is extracted, aggregated, and saved as an output report under the output subdirectory within each scenario.

The primary software, Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD), helps determine the combination of health policies and intervention strategies that can lead to disease eradication. EMOD calculates how diseases may spread in particular areas and is used to analyze the effects of current and future health policies and intervention strategies. It supports infectious disease campaign planning, data gathering, new product development, and policy decisions. We share this modeling software with the research community to advance the understanding of disease dynamics. EMOD supports the following simulation types for modeling a variety of diseases: Generic disease (GENERIC_SIM) Vector-borne diseases (VECTOR_SIM) Malaria (MALARIA_SIM) Tuberculosis (TB_SIM) Sexually transmitted infections (STI_SIM) HIV (HIV_SIM) The illustration below shows how the simulation types are built upon one another. All parameters available in the generic simulation type are inherited by the vector simulation type. The vector simulation type adds additional parameters specific to the biology of vector-borne diseases, which in turn are inherited by the malaria simulation type and so on. Therefore, depending on the simulation type you select, different parameters are available for you to use. Simulation type inheritance EMOD is a stochastic , agent-based model that simulates the actions and interactions of individuals within geographic areas known as nodes to understand the disease dynamics in a population over time. EMOD can produce statistically significant results over a broad set of parameters and scenarios. Quantitative analysis of the simulated output enables disease eradication efforts to make more data-driven decisions. The IDM research team has published many articles related to modeling, as well as the modeling concepts underpinning EMOD. For a list of published articles, see IDM Publications . While EMOD is very powerful, it can be challenging to learn if you are not already familiar with epidemiology and disease modeling. If that is the case, IDM provides the Quick Start for you to learn more about modeling disease dynamics. It has a simpler interface for running simulations and extensive tutorials that walk you through how to model several prepared real- world scenarios. The Quick Start is installed separately from, and has fewer installation requirements than, the EMOD source. The Quick Start is built on the same modeling software, but has a few limitations that make it primarily a learning tool. It is not suitable for running large-scale simulations or running simulations using your own data. The Quick Start provides the following: All files needed to model many different prepared real-world scenarios Extensive tutorials that walk you through how to model the scenarios An Excel Front End and Windows batch files to quickly and easy run simulations Windows batch files to create graphs of the model output Built EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) Note The Quick Start can only be run locally on a 64-bit Windows computer and the Excel Front End is only supported on 32-bit Microsoft Excel, though there is a workaround if you do not want to reinstall your version of Excel. See Troubleshooting . The Quick Start is not updated as frequently as the EMOD source, so may not contain all parameters available in the latest version of EMOD. In addition, while you can modify the parameter values, you cannot add or subtract parameters from JSON files within the Excel Front End. This section provides the conceptual overview of EMOD. The architecture diagram below shows, at a high level, how the system functions. If you run simulations in parallel on a multi-node cluster, there is also a Message Passing Interface (MPI) component used to pass data between multiple instances of EMOD. High-level EMOD system architecture Input data files \u00b6 Not all files accepted as input for running a simulation are considered input data files. Rather, input data files contain the relatively fixed information about a population to model. For example, climate, geography, demographics, and migration data. Configuration file \u00b6 The configuration file contains parameters that control many different aspects of the simulation. EMOD provides hundreds of parameters for you to configure your simulation. For example, configuration parameters can control the following: The disease or disease class to simulate (simulation type) The name and location for the input data files and output files Whether to include births, deaths, and migration Disease attributes, such as infectivity, transmission, immunity, and mortality The computing resources to use Campaign file \u00b6 The campaign file contains parameters that distribute outbreaks and the interventions used to control the spread of disease. For example, campaign parameters can control the following: Target demographic (age, location, gender, etc.) for interventions Diagnostic tests to use The cost and timing of interventions Running a simulation \u00b6 The EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) accepts the input data, configuration, and campaign files and then simulates the susceptibility and infection of individuals within each geographic node . The simulation type controls the transmission mechanism of the disease. After the simulation is complete, the Eradication.exe produces output reports that describe various aspects of the disease dynamics within the modeled population. Output files \u00b6 After the simulation finishes, a reporter extracts simulation data, aggregates it, and outputs it to a file (known as an output report ). Most of the reports are also JSON files, the most important of which is InsetChart.json. The InsetChart.json file provides simulation-wide averages of disease prevalence at each time step .

It is based on a simple SEIRS model with enhancements. For example, the duration spent in the latent state can be set to be a fixed interval rather than an exponentially-distributed duration. This provides the EMOD agent-based framework with some advantages over the continuum approximations of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) -based model. In particular, the advanced user can go beyond these four states by using the built-in immunity functions for acquiring infection, transmitting infection, and dying from infection. These are all available in the simple disease model. Many users, though, will want to study aspects of malaria infections and population dynamics that do not fit into the SEIRS framework. We have developed a detailed microsolver using within-host parasite dynamics as described in Eckhoff, Malaria Journal 2011, 10:303 where development of clinical and parasitological immunity is tracked through innate and adaptive immune responses to specific antigens. A detailed parasite count over time is tracked for each infected individual, permitting simulation of measured prevalence over time by slide microscopy, Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs), or other diagnostics. Gametocyte production and decay is included to study the human infectious reservoir. This tutorial provides a basic template for running the same simulation of the vector population, but with infections in the human population simulated with the detailed parasite microsolver.

Modern bednets are made of a polyethylene or polyester mesh which is impregnated with a slowly releasing pyrethroid insecticide. Mosquitoes that are seeking a blood meal will encounter a net, and if the net retains its physical integrity and has been correctly installed the feeding attempt is blocked. Blocked feeding attempts carry the possibility of killing the mosquito.

Interventions are configured in the campaign file . They are enabled in the configuration file by setting the parameter, Enable_Interventions , to 1. The configuration file also indicates the name of the campaign file. Warning The Outbreak must be the last event in the campaign file or none of the interventions will take place. EMOD supports a variety of supported campaign interventions. It is worth noting that each intervention contains multiple parameters used to configure that specific event. For example, the distribution of bednets behaves differently in the model than does the use of larvicides. It is therefore important to ensure that interventions are configured correctly and applied to the appropriate level target (individual versus node). This framework enables rigorous testing of possible control strategies to determine which events or combination of events will best aid in the elimination of disease for specific geographic locations. Warning Parameters are case-sensitive. For Boolean parameters, set to 1 for true or 0 for false. The tables below contain only parameters available when using the training tutorials.

You can specify this with a dictionary specifying habitat type with a simple numeric scaling factor or, for LINEAR_SPLINE, with a more detailed configuration for scaling. Possible habitat values are: \u201cCONSTANT\u201d \u201cTEMPORARY_RAINFALL\u201d \u201cWATER_VEGETATION\u201d \u201cHUMAN_POPULATION\u201d \u201cBRACKISH_SWAMP\u201d \u201cLINEAR_SPLINE\u201d The numeric scaling value represents larval density with the number of larvae in a 1x1-degree area. The factor multiplicatively scales the resulting weather or population dependent functional form. The LINEAR_SPLINE configuration specifies the day of year, larval value, and larval capacity scaling number. The model linearly interpolates the values to estimate the habitat availability for each vector species without requiring climatological data. The following example shows how to specify the larval habitat using one of the climatological habitat types. { \"Larval_Habitat_Types\" : { \"TEMPORARY_RAINFALL\" : 1000000 }} The following example shows how to specify larval habitat using LINEAR_SPLINE. { \"Larval_Habitat_Types\" : { \"LINEAR_SPLINE\" : { \"Capacity_Distribution_Per_Year\" : { \"Times\" : [ 0.0 , 60.833 , 121.667 , 182.5 , 243.333 , 204.167 ], \"Values\" : [ 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.2 , 1.0 , 0.5 , 0.0 ] }, \"Max_Larval_Capacity\" : 10000000000 } } } Vector_Species_Params JSON object NA NA NA For each of the species specified in Vector_Species_Name, there is a set of required species-parameters.

For example, the number of individuals and the distribution for age, gender, immunity, risk, and mortality. This is in contrast to the configuration parameters related to demographics that are simulation-wide and generally control whether certain events, such as births or deaths, are enabled in a simulation. At least one demographics file is required for every simulation unless you set the parameter Enable_Demographics_Builtin to 0 (zero) in the configuration file . This is generally only used for testing and validating code pathways by using a standard testing sandbox instead of actual demographics information. If Migration_Model is set to \u201cFIXED_RATE_MIGRATION\u201d, built-in demographics will use a form of local migration where individuals migrate only to adjacent nodes. Demographics files are usually the only input data file you will modify. Demographics files are named using the name of the region, appended with \u201c_demographics.json\u201d. Additionally, you can use more than one demographics file, with one serving as the base layer and the one or more others acting as overlays that override the values in the base layer. Contents Demographic file structure Metadata Defaults Nodes Parameters NodeAttributes IndividualAttributes IndividualProperties Example Demographic file structure \u00b6 Demographics files are organized into three sections: Metadata Information such as data source, created date or region name. Metadata is used to provide provenance information. Defaults Default parameter values applied to all nodes. Nodes Parameter values specific to individual geographic nodes, which override the default values. There is one entry for each node in the simulation. The following example shows the skeletal format of a demographics file. { \"Metadata\" : { \"DateCreated\" : \"dateTime\" , \"Tool\" : \"scriptUsedToGenerate\" , \"Author\" : \"author\" , \"IdReference\" : \"ID reference\" , \"NodeCount\" : 2 }, \"Defaults\" : { \"NodeAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualProperties\" : {} }, \"Nodes\" : [{ \"NodeID\" : 1 , \"NodeAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualProperties\" : {} }, { \"NodeID\" : 2 , \"NodeAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualAttributes\" : {}, \"IndividualProperties\" : {} }] } Metadata \u00b6 Most of the items in the Metadata section informational only and are not used by EMOD. This includes information such as author, date created, and tool used to create the file. However, the following two values are used by EMOD: NodeCount The number of nodes to expect in the demographics file. IdReference The unique string that indicates the method used for generating the NodeID , the identifier used for each node in the simulation. Defaults \u00b6 Parameter values in the Defaults section is applied to all nodes. However, any node-level information provided in the Nodes section will take precedence for that node. The Defaults section is optional and can be completely omitted, as is often the case of single- node simulations. The Defaults section can contain any of the parameters listed below. Nodes \u00b6 Parameter values in the Nodes section is applied to specific nodes. The intent of the Nodes section is to have only the information that is unique to each node, such as identifier and location (longitude and latitude). The section contains an array with each element in the array representing a node that is identified by its NodeID . The NodeID is a unique integer value. If a parameter appears in both the Defaults and Nodes sections, the value in the Nodes section will take precedence. The Nodes section can contain any of the parameters listed below, except for the Society parameters that can only be applied in the Defaults section. Parameters \u00b6 The demographic parameters are divided into the following broad categories. The parameters will be contained in a nested JSON object of the same name. Warning Parameters are case-sensitive. For Boolean parameters, set to 1 for true or 0 for false. NodeAttributes \u00b6 NodeAttributes are a JSON object that contains parameters that add or modify information regarding the location, migration, habitat, and population of a simulation. Some NodeAttributes depend on values set in the configuration parameters.

If Animal_Reservoir_Type is set to \u201cZOONOSIS_FROM_DEMOGRAPHICS\u201d, the value for Zoonosis overrides the value set for Zoonosis_Rate in the configuration file. { \"Zoonosis\" : 0 } IndividualAttributes \u00b6 IndividualAttributes are a JSON object that contains parameters that add or modify the distribution of attributes across individuals in a simulation. For example, the age or immunity distribution. An initial value for an individual is a randomly selected value from a distribution. For example, if you use a uniform distribution to initialize age, the initial ages of individuals in the simulation will be evenly distributed between some minimum and maximum value. There are two types of distributions: simple and complex. Simple distributions are defined by three parameters where one is the distribution type and the other two are used to further define the distribution. You can use complex distributions to define a distribution that does not fit some standard. For example, a complex distribution is useful when trying to represent real-world data. The table below shows the simple distributions and their associated parameters. Distribution Demographic parameters Related configuration parameters Age AgeDistributionFlag AgeDistribution1 AgeDistribution2 Age_Initialization_Distribution_Type must be set to \u201cDISTRIBUTION_SIMPLE\u201d. Prevalence PrevalenceDistributionFlag PrevalenceDistribution1 PrevalenceDistribution2 Enable_Demographics_Other must be set to 1. Immunity ImmunityDistributionFlag ImmunityDistribution1 ImmunityDistribution2 \u00a0 Risk RiskDistributionFlag RiskDistribution1 RiskDistribution2 Enable_Demographics_Other must be set to 1. Migration heterogeneity MigrationHeterogeneityDistributionFlag MigrationHeterogeneityDistribution1 MigrationHeterogeneityDistribution2 Enable_Migration_Heterogeneity must be set to 1. The table below shows the available probability distribution types to use with simple distributions and how to set the other two demographic parameters to initialize the distribution. Distribution type Flag value Distribution1 value Distribution2 value Constant 0 Value N/A (set to 0) Uniform 1 Minimum Maximum Gaussian 2 Mean Standard deviation Exponential 3 Mean N/A (set to 0) Poisson 4 Mean N/A (set to 0) Log normal 5 Mean Log (standard deviation) Bimodal 6 Proportion of time to return the value specified by Distribution2. Value must be between 0 and 1. A positive value to be returned. If the value is not positive, a value of 1 is returned. Weibull 7 Scale parameter Shape parameter EMOD also supports the following complex distributions: AgeDistribution FertilityDistribution MortalityDistribution MortalityDistributionMale MortalityDistributionFemale HIVCoinfectionDistribution HIVMortalityDistribution MSP_mean_antibody_distribution nonspec_mean_antibody_distribution PfEMP1_mean_antibody_distribution MSP_variance_antibody_distribution nonspec_variance_antibody_distribution Malaria PfEMP1_variance_antibody_distribution IndividualProperties \u00b6 IndividualProperties are a JSON array that contains parameters that add properties to individuals in a simulation as a means of setting up groups. For example, you can define values for accessibility, age, geography, risk, and other properties and assign individuals to different groups based on those property values. Parameter Data type Description Example Property string The property type for which you will assign values to create groups. Accepted values are: Accessibility Geographic Place Risk QualityofCare HasActiveTB Age_Bin { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"Property\" : \"Risk\" }] } Values array An array of the user-defined values that can be assigned to individuals for this property. You can have up to 125 values for the Geographic property type and up to 5 values for all other types. For \u201cAge_Bin\u201d property types, omit and use Age_Bin_In_Years instead. { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"Values\" : [ \"Low\" , \"Medium\" , \"High\" ] }] } Initial_Distribution array An array of numbers that define the proportion of individuals to assign to each group at the beginning of the simulation. Their total must equal 1 and the number of members in this array must match the number of members in Values . For \u201cAge_Bin\u201d property types, omit this parameter as the demographics file controls the age distribution. { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"Initial_Distribution\" : [ 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.4 ] }] } Age_Bin_In_Years array An array of integers that represents the ages, in years, at which to demarcate the age groups. Used only with the \u201cAge_Bin\u201d property type. The first number must be 0, the last must be -1, and they must be listed in ascending order. The following example creates three age groups: 0 to 5, older than 5 to 13, and older than 13 to the maximum age. { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"Age_Bin_In_Years\" : [ 0 , 5 , 13 , -1 ] }] } Transitions array An array contains multiple JSON objects that each define how an individual transitions from one property group to another. See the following table for information about the parameters to include in the object. For \u201cAge_Bin\u201d property types, set to an empty array, as individuals will transition to the next age bin based on the passing of time. { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"Transitions\" : [] }] } TransmissionMatrix array An object that contains Route and Matrix parameters that define how to scale the base infectivity from individuals in one group to individuals in another. { \"IndividualProperties\" : [{ \"TransmissionMatrix\" : { \"Route\" : \"Contact\" , \"Matrix\" : [ [ 10 , 0.1 ], [ 0.1 , 1 ] ] } }] } The following table contains the parameters that are available to use in the Transitions array. Parameter Data type Description Example From string Which group an individual will transition from. { \"Transitions\" : [{ \"From\" : \"Low\" }] } To string Which group an individual will transition to. { \"Transitions\" : [{ \"To\" : \"High\" }] } Type string The type of condition that starts transitioning individuals. Set to \u201cAt_Age\u201d or \u201cAt_Timestep\u201d. The other parameters you must set depend on the condition type set here. { \"Transitions\" : [{ \"Type\" : \"At_Age\" }] } Age_In_Years_Restriction nested JSON object The age when an individual is eligible to transition. Min is optional and Max is required. Do not use this with \u201cAt_Age\u201d types because it will conflict with other age parameters in Age_In_Years . This is required for \u201cAt_Timestep\u201d types, though it can be empty for no age restriction. { \"Transitions\" : [{ \"Type\" : \"At_Timestep\" , \"Age_In_Years_Restriction\" : { \"Min\" : 5 , \"Max\" : 40 } }] } Timestep_Restriction nested JSON object The time step when transitioning starts and stops. Required for both \u201cAt_Age\u201d and \u201cAt_Timestep\u201d types. Start is required and End is optional. { \"Transitions\" : [{ \"Timestep_Restriction\" : { \"Start\" : 20 } }] } Coverage float A value between 0 and 1 that indicates the proportion of the population that EMOD will attempt to transition. The calculation used with Probability_Per_Timeset only uses the proportion of the population specified in Cover to calculate the probability of an individual transitioning at a given time step. Coverage has no effect when the value is set to 1. Required for both \u201cAt_Age\u201d and \u201cAt_Timestep\u201d types. { \"Transitions\" : [{ \"Coverage\" : 0.5 }] } Probability_Per_Timestep float A value between 0 and 1 that is used to calculate the probability of an individual transitioning at the current time step given the number of individuals remaining in the group. Required for both \u201cAt_Age\u201d and \u201cAt_Timestep\u201d types. { \"Transitions\" : [{ \"Probability_Per_Timestep\" : 0.25 }] } Age_In_Years integer The age at which individuals are eligible to transition. Do not use for \u201cAt_Timestep\u201d types. Required for \u201cAt_Age\u201d types. { \"Transitions\" : [{ \"Type\" : \"At_Age\" , \"Age_In_Years\" : 10 }] } Timesteps_Until_Reversion integer The number of time steps after the start of transitioning when individuals revert back to their original group. The start of transitioning is specified by the Start parameter in Timestep_Restriction . { \"Transitions\" : [{ \"Timestep_Restriction\" : { \"Start\" : 20 }, \"Timesteps_Until_Reversion\" : 100 }] }

configurable parameters described in this reference section determine the behavior of a particular simulation and interventions. The parameter descriptions are intended to guide you in correctly configuring simulations to match your disease scenario of interest. These parameters include three major groups: parameters for the demographics file , parameters for the configuration file , and parameters for the campaign file . JSON formatting overview \u00b6 All of these parameters are contained in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted files. JSON is a data format that is human-readable and easy for software to read and generate. It can be created and edited using a simple text editor. JSON has two basic structures: a collection of key-value pairs or an ordered list of values (an array). These structures are within a JSON object, which is enclosed in a set of braces. You will notice that each of these files begins with a left brace ({) and ends with a right brace (}). A value can be a string, number, Boolean, array, or an object. The campaign and data input files often use nested objects and arrays. See www.json.org for more information on JSON. A few important details to call out when creating JSON files: Add a comma after every key-value pair or array except for the last key-value pair in an array or object. The keys (parameters) are case-sensitive. For example, \u201cNodeID\u201d is not the same as \u201cNodeId\u201d. Decimals require a 0 (zero) before the decimal point. EMOD does not support Booleans (\u201cTrue\u201d, \u201cFalse\u201d). Instead, EMOD use the integer 1 for \u201cTrue\u201d and 0 for \u201cFalse\u201d. Every opening brace or bracket ({ or [) requires a corresponding closing brace or bracket (} or ]). The following is an example of a JSON formatted file. { \"A_Complex_Key\" : { \"An_Array_with_a_Nested_Object_Value\" : [ { \"A_Simple_Key\" : \"Value\" , \"A_Simple_Array\" : [ \"Value1\" , \"Value2\" ], \"An_Array_with_Number_Values\" : [ 0.1 , 0.2 ], \"A_Nested_Object\" : { \"Another_Simple_Key\" : \"Value\" , \"Nested_Arrays\" : [ [ 10 , 0.1 ], [ 0.1 , 1 ] ] } } ] } } Demographics file structure and parameters Configuration parameters Campaign parameters", "tags": "", "title": "EMOD parameter reference \u2014 Training Tutorials  documentation"}, {"url": "./search-local.html", "text": "Search results \u00b6", "tags": "", "title": "Search results \u2014 Training Tutorials  documentation"}, {"url": "./search.html", "text": "Please activate JavaScript to enable the search functionality.", "tags": "", "title": "Search \u2014 Training Tutorials  documentation"}, {"url": "./troubleshooting.html", "text": "Troubleshooting \u00b6 If you encounter any of the following errors or problems when attempting to run simulations with the Quick Start, see the information below to resolve the issue.

Each of the tutorials in the Quick Start documentation describes in more detail how to modify various parameters to model disease and the rationale and mathematics behind the EMOD model. This topic describes in a broader sense how to run simulations. Outside of the Quick Start, simulations are generally run using command-line options and the JSON files that control the configuration and campaign are modified directly. While there\u2019s nothing preventing you from running simulations using the scenarios here at the command line, this process is not documented here because it is more complicated.

In general, we assume you will be running simulations using the Excel Front End because this interface allows you to easily view and modify the parameters associated with each of the scenarios and greater control in plotting the output. However, you also have the option of running scenarios using the provided Windows command and batch scripts. Run a simulation using the Excel Front End \u00b6 Open Windows Explorer. Navigate to the Quick Start on the virtual Z drive (or other virtual drive you set up during installation). If you get an error, re-run the environment setup script. See Install the Quick Start . In the Scenarios directory, open the directory of the scenario you want to simulate. The tutorials will guide you through the scenarios in greater detail. Double-click config.xlsm. If a warning appears, click Update to dismiss it. If you\u2019ve made any changes, save the workbook. The Commissioning sheet contains parameters that control how and where the simulation runs. You generally will not need to modify this sheet. The other sheets contain configuration and campaign parameters. Follow the instructions in the tutorial to modify these parameters as necessary. Select the CONTROL sheet tab. Click EXECUTE . If a security notice appears, click Enable Macros to dismiss it. This will open a Command Prompt window for simulation output and logging. Ignore the EMOD_Macros.xslm file that opens. In the Command Prompt window, verify that you see the following output: \u201cController executed successfully.\u201d Close the Command Prompt window to open the InsetChart workbook. This workbook contains the simulation-wide averages of prevalence , incidence , and other common metrics at each time step . If desired, use Save as to save the results of the simulation with a different name. By default, files will be saved in the testing directory. To plot the output, press Ctrl and select the columns of interest, then on the Insert tab, select a 2-D line chart. For example, press Ctrl and select columns B, J, and L to plot the recovered, susceptible, and infectious populations at each time step. Of course, you can use any of the Microsoft Excel plotting features to plot the output data in different ways. Run a simulation using scripts \u00b6 Open Windows Explorer. Navigate to the Quick Start on the virtual Z drive (or other virtual drive you set up during installation). If you get an error, re-run the environment setup script. See Install the Quick Start . In the Scenarios directory, open the directory of the scenario you want to simulate. If you want to make changes to the campaign or configuration files, open the JSON file in a text editor, make your changes, and save. The tutorials will guide you through the scenarios in greater detail. Double-click runEmod.cmd. This will open a Command Prompt window for simulation output and logging. In the Command Prompt window, verify that you see the following output: \u201cController executed successfully.\u201d You may then close the window. By default, output files will be saved in the output directory. To plot the output, double-click plotInsetChart.bat or plotAllCharts.bat. These batch files use Python to create plots of campaign cost, exposed and recovered population, new infections, and more. Note that all batch files assume that Python is installed at C:Python27. If Python is installed in a different location, use a plain text editor to modify the path in the batch files.", "tags": "", "title": "How to run Quick Start simulations \u2014 Training Tutorials  documentation"}]};
